Whether you're lifting heavy or HIIT-ing it hard, one of the best ways to help your body recover after a tough workout is to consume some protein. Maybe you add a scoop of protein powder to water or blend it into a smoothie.



But for some people—especially those with tummy troubles—chasing down a protein shake doesn't feel so great and can cause an upset stomach. This is where hydrolyzed protein powder can help; this quick-absorbing protein might offer faster recovery, better digestion, and an easier time hitting your macros. Here's what you should know.


   What the Heck Is Hydrolyzed Protein Powder?  

If you've researched protein powders before, you've probably heard of protein concentrate (which contains fats and carbs and is lower in protein) and isolate (in which fats and carbs are reduced, so protein content is higher). But there's a new protein formulation that's becoming popular for its super-fast absorption: hydrolyzed, or hydrolysate, proteins.



""Hydrolyzed means that it's been broken down to some degree and is quicker to digest,"" explains Brittany Michels, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.N., a nutrition expert for The Vitamin Shoppe. ""The hydrolysis process normally includes either protein digestive enzymes or heating a protein with acid. Both help to break proteins down into singular or smaller-chained amino acids for easier digestion and absorption.""







Let's back up: Amino acids are the building blocks of all proteins. And by breaking down the protein into even smaller chains of amino acids, called peptides, hydrolysis essentially makes these proteins pre-digested so it's easier for your body to absorb the protein more quickly.



""Smaller di- and tripeptides are absorbed as they are. Larger peptides require further breakdown prior to absorption,"" says Marie Spano, M.S., R.D., C.S.C.S., C.S.S.D., consulting sports nutritionist for the Atlanta Braves and lead author of Nutrition for Sport, Exercise, and Health. ""I like to think of hydrolyzed protein as a car versus non-hydrolyzed protein as a truck that transports several cars at the same time. Both have the same engine. The car will go a lot faster than a bigger truck with several cars on it. Or you can think of it like cars going through a toll booth. Hydrolyzed proteins have an EZ pass and cruise right through, while non-hydrolyzed proteins have to stop and pay a toll, another process that slows them down,"" she says.



If you're considering adding hydrolyzed protein powder into your diet, here are some things to consider before picking up a tub of this stuff.


   The Benefits of Hydrolyzed Protein Powder  
  It's easier on your stomach.  

Good news: Hydrolyzed protein powders are less likely to cause a stomachache and gut issues. The lactose in traditional whey protein powders can cause digestive distress, such as bloating, diarrhea, and cramping, especially in people who are lactose intolerant. But ""the hydrolysis process results in a whey protein powder that is lower in lactose, as well as lower in fat and carbs,"" says Rebekah Blakely, R.D.N., an expert for The Vitamin Shoppe. That said, if you have a more severe dairy allergy or intolerance, you may do better with a plant-based hydrolyzed protein, according to Blakely. ""Even though the hydrolysis process typically results in a lower lactose product—sometimes even lactose-free—a whey product will still contain milk proteins, which isn't a good option for those with a dairy allergy,"" says Blakely.


  It's lower in carbs and fats.  

The hydrolysis process results in a whey protein powder that's more concentrated protein, making it lower in fat and carbs as well, says Blakely. Due to its lower fat and carb content, Michels says hydrolyzed protein powders are also great for those following low-carb and low-fat diets.


  It might help you recover faster.  

Turns out, faster absorption may mean faster recovery, too. Because hydrolyzed protein powder contains smaller peptides than non-hydrolyzed protein, it's more rapidly absorbed in the GI tract and more readily available for use by the body, making recovery post-workout more efficient, says Blakely. ""Not only does this result in a quicker supply of nutrients to your strained muscles, but it may result in overall better absorption of protein for some individuals. This can potentially improve recovery time and reduce muscle soreness,"" she says.



A little extra background: When you work out, you create small tears in your muscles, which results in the breakdown of protein. Amino acids are needed to help repair those tissues. There are non-essential amino acids, which your body can make on its own, and then there are essential amino acids, which you need to get from food or supplements. Certain essential amino acids called branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)—leucine, valine, and isoleucine—are stored in the muscles for energy and play a significant role in muscle recovery.



""Without proper intake of protein and uptake of digested amino acids, muscle recovery would be prolonged,"" says Michels. ""The hydrolyzed process breaks down protein into smaller-chained amino acids, which promotes speedier absorption and allows for quicker muscle repair and rebuild,"" she says. Because hydrolyzed protein has faster absorption, it might supply BCAAs to your muscles more quickly. ""Hydrolyzed protein powders don't necessarily have higher quantities of BCAAs unless the manufacturer has added extra amino acids during processing,"" says Blakely. ""The branch chain amino acids in the protein will just be more quickly accessible due to the decreased absorption time.""


  Research On Hydrolyzed Protein  

This all makes sense in theory, but what does science say about hydrolyzed protein? The short answer is that there isn't enough research. ""There are relatively few well-designed studies examining hydrolyzed protein versus non-hydrolyzed protein,"" says Spano. ""I suspect hydrolyzed forms may be superior to non-hydrolyzed forms for slower-digesting proteins, like casein, but we don't know the magnitude of the benefit, if any, over time,"" she explains. Moreover, research hasn't delved into the differences between hydrolyzed whey, casein, collagen, soy, and other plant-based proteins and their effectiveness for recovery compared to their non-hydrolyzed counterparts.



A small 2010 study in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport compared the recovery effects of hydrolysate whey protein versus whey protein isolate. In the study, 28 participants consumed either 25 grams of hydrolysate whey protein in flavored water or 25 grams of whey protein isolate in flavored water. Results showed that the participants who consumed the hydrolysate whey protein powder recovered their muscle power better and faster than those who consumed the flavored water with whey protein isolate after an intense workout. However, there was no difference in muscle soreness between the two whey proteins. ""Based on this study, it's possible hydrolyzed whey protein may have some benefits over whey protein isolate, especially if you're an athlete who trains hard one day and has to recover fast before the next day,"" says Spano.



Research has shown that hydrolyzed protein powder can also help with restoring glycogen post-workout. (FYI, your body uses glycogen for energy, which is stored in your liver and muscles.) Restoring glycogen after a workout is essential so you have fuel for your next workout and to limit post-workout muscle damage, according to a 2004 article in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine.



According to a small 2000 study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, adding protein hydrolysate to a carbohydrate drink provides the same glycogen-replenishing benefits as drinking a higher-carb drink. Participants drank their beverages every 30 minutes, and five hours post-exercise, muscle biopsies were taken. This study backs up previous research that adding protein to low-dose carbs can promote faster glycogen synthesis, aka the process of restoring glycogen, says Spano.



""The addition of protein can help restore glycogen stores in the muscles post-workout, as opposed to having high amounts of carbohydrates only,"" says Blakely. In fact, a September 2004 study in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine demonstrated that consuming a protein supplement in addition to a carbohydrate one after exercise can help improve the rate of replenishing muscle glycogen; the study showed that adding protein to a carbohydrate supplement increased the rate of glycogen storage by approximately 38 percent over the first four hours of recovery. ""This may be due to the synergistic effect the two macronutrients (protein and carbohydrates) have on insulin response and muscle repair,"" explains Blakely.



That's because the majority of the carbs you eat are converted into glucose for fuel and when you aren't using it, it's converted into glycogen. For glucose to convert into glycogen, insulin is needed to direct glucose from your blood to your liver and muscles. And hydrolyzed protein has been shown to have a faster insulin response than non-hydrolyzed proteins because the proteins are already broken down and it's absorbed into the body so quickly, says Michels. ""Glycogen storage is turned on during this stimulated insulin response,"" she says. An October 2015 review in the World Journal of Diabetes suggests that hydrolysate whey protein stimulates insulin secretion at a greater rate than intact whey protein and whey isolate.



If hydrolyzed protein might help you repair muscles and recover glycogen faster, it makes sense that it can give you an athletic edge over non-hydrolyzed protein, right? Time and more research will tell. ""Yes, hydrolyzed protein is absorbed faster, so it leads to a faster rise in amino acids and sooner peak in muscle protein synthesis, but does this make a difference when training over time? We don't know. It may be beneficial for very long duration workouts, where ease of digestion and fast absorption are more tolerable,"" says Spano. So if you're racking up miles for marathon or triathlon training, or gearing up for a bodybuilding competition, for instance, hydrolyzed protein powder may help, due to your increased performance and recovery demands, says Michels.


  Hydrolyzed Whey vs. Plant-Based Protein Blends  

When it comes to building strength and lean muscle mass, whey protein powder is the gold standard. In a September 2016 review in Nutrition & Metabolism, researchers measured the level of leucine—one of the BCAAs needed for muscle repair—in different types of protein powders, including soy, pea protein, and rice protein, and found that whey protein had the highest concentration of leucine.



But for hydrolyzed protein powders, it's hard to say which one comes out on top. For one thing, each protein powder product has its own method of hydrolyzing, which yields different varieties of protein breakdown, says Michels. ""For example, one hydrolyzed whey company may have more singular amino acids present than another. And because all types of protein have varying amino acid profiles and hydrolysis processes, it's hard to say one is superior,"" explains Michels.



However, research shows that non-hydrolyzed whey has superior absorption rates over non-hydrolyzed plant proteins, says Michels. ""It would be safe to predict that if this is the case with non-hydrolyzed whey, that it would ring true with hydrolyzed whey as well,"" she says.



Moreover, based on protein digestibility-corrected amino acid scores (PDCASS), which rates protein quality based on amino acid profile and digestibility, whey protein (and other animal proteins) have a better PDCASS score than plant-based proteins. That's because—with the exception of soy—plant proteins are incomplete proteins, meaning they don't contain sufficient amounts of all essential amino acids, whereas whey (and other animal proteins) do. ""A plant-based protein powder can provide all the essential amino acids, though, by combining various plant sources to make complete proteins,"" says Blakely. (



Vegan Protein Powders That Don't Taste Like Dirt



The main thing you want to focus on between protein powders is the source of protein. ""You will get a different breakdown of peptides and amino acids depending on the original protein source,"" says Blakely. ""Whey and soy are complete proteins, whereas pea protein is not complete. That doesn't make pea protein a bad option, but you'll want to make sure you're getting other complete proteins in your diet,"" she says. For example, an August 2018 study in Amino Acids found that while plant-based protein isolates don't have sufficient amounts of the muscle-building amino acids leucine, lysine, and methionine, combining different plant-based proteins or blending plant-based proteins with animal-based ones can provide the ideal essential amino acid profile you want.



All that said, whey appears to be the only hydrolyzed protein powder available on the market right now; interestingly, hydrolyzed soy is sometimes used as an additive in food (and can even appear as baby formula). But it's unclear why hydrolyzed soy protein powders aren't really available in the market, says Spano. This could be due to how new hydrolyzed protein supplements are, and also due to the fact that people don't have the same trouble digesting soy as they do with whey.


   Who Should Try Hydrolyzed Protein Powder?  

Spano recommends hydrolyzed protein powders for people who have issues digesting regular protein powders. ""Those who try a pretty pure—meaning, few ingredients—protein isolate and still get an upset stomach should try a hydrolyzed protein,"" says Spano. ""These may be especially helpful for those with malabsorption issues, like a person with IBS,"" she says. As pointed out earlier, hydrolyzed whey or hydrolyzed plant-based proteins may also be a good option for those who don't do well with whey.



Both Michels and Blakely also recommend hydrolyzed protein powders for those who want to gain lean muscle, do intense exercise, and/or have higher recovery demands. ""Individuals looking for a competitive edge may benefit from the use of a hydrolyzed protein powder, as they may be able to utilize a larger percentage of the amino acids for muscle building and repair,"" says Blakely. ""Those looking for quicker recovery between workouts may also want to consider it,"" she adds.



How often you should consume hydrolyzed protein depends on your own recovery and muscle-building needs, but you can consume it as you would with other protein powders. ""It can be used pre- or post-workout daily for muscle maintenance and recovery, and also be used to help meet your daily protein needs,"" says Blakely. ""I generally recommend using it no more than once to twice daily. Aim to get the rest of your proteins from whole food sources,"" she says. (



Here's How Much Protein You Actually Need Each Day



If you're using hydrolyzed protein to replace protein in a meal, Blakely suggests combining it with fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats for a balanced and complete nutrient profile. ""For an athlete looking for gains, coupling hydrolyzed protein with healthy carbohydrates may be of benefit,"" says Michels, especially if you're seeking better muscle recovery. ""But those using it for non-exercise functions, such as improved digestion, may not benefit from coupling it with other foods,"" she says.



As always, it's best to consult a registered dietitian about how to safely and effectively incorporate hydrolyzed protein powder in your diet—and remember that getting added protein through supplements is by no means necessary. Most people can meet their protein needs through whole foods alone.


   How to Shop for Hydrolyzed Protein Powder  

When choosing a hydrolyzed protein powder, you should look for ""100-percent hydrolyzed"" on the label for the fastest absorption, says Blakely. Some protein powders contain both hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed protein, so if you're looking for a powder that contains only hydrolyzed protein, verify it on the label. The hydrolyzed protein should also be the first ingredient on the list, which indicates that it's the ingredient in the greatest amount in the product. (



Should You Be Taking Pre-Workout Supplements?



""Some labels will provide BCAA and amino acid profiles, which can be additional factors to compare, based on your own needs,"" says Michels. Lastly, you want to choose hydrolyzed protein powders that have minimal, clean ingredients; ideally, one that's certified organic and is free of artificial colors and sweeteners. Keep in mind that hydrolyzed protein powders tend to be pricier than concentrate and isolate. Before you buy, it's good practice to check if the product is certified by an independent, not-for-profit organization, like NSF International, which ensures that it does, in fact, contain what it claims to have on the label and doesn't have prohibited substances and unsafe levels of contaminants.

As plant-based eating becomes more and more popular, alternative protein sources have been flooding the food market. From beans to tempeh, there are almost too many to count. You may have seen pea protein amongst these popular plant-based protein alternatives, but still be a bit confused about how on earth peas could ever be an adequate source of protein.



Here, experts give the scoop on this nutrient-dense little powerhouse. Read on for all the pros and cons of pea protein and why it's worth your attention — even if you're not vegan or plant-based.


   What Is Pea Protein?  

""Thanks to its shelf-stable, easy-to-add appeal, pea protein is easily becoming a trendy, economical, sustainable, and nutrient-rich protein source,"" says Sharon Palmer, registered dietitian. Sure enough, pea protein powder, shakes, supplements, plant-based milk, and veggie burgers have hit the market.



For example, mainstream brands are hopping on the pea protein bandwagon. Ripple Foods, a dairy-free milk company, makes products with pea milk. The company was drawn to peas because they're actually more sustainable than almonds, as they use less water and produce fewer CO2 emissions, explains Adam Lowry, co-founder of Ripple. The company includes pea protein in their plant-based milk and protein shakes, which feature up to 8 and 20 grams of pea protein per serving, respectively.



And this is just the beginning: A 2022 market report conducted by Grand View Research suggests that the global pea protein market size in 2016 was $73.4 million — a number that's projected to rise exponentially by 2025.



Pea protein is just part of the booming growth of the non-dairy market as a whole, says Rossettini. ""According to recent data from Information Resources, Inc., the non-dairy milk segment is expected to grow to $4 billion by 2020,"" she says. (Not totally surprising, considering there are tons of delicious non-dairy milk options available now.)


   Is Pea Protein Good for You?  

Why is pea protein worth your attention? The Journal of Renal Nutrition reports that pea protein offers some legit health benefits. For one, pea protein is not derived from any of the eight most common allergenic foods (milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish, shellfish, and wheat), which are often used to create protein supplements — meaning it's a safe option for people with various dietary restrictions. Preliminary studies also show that pea protein intake can actually reduce blood pressure in hypertensive rats and humans, according to the report. One potential reason: Because pea protein is often derived mechanically from ground yellow split peas (versus chemical separation, often used for soy and whey proteins), it retains more soluble fiber, which ultimately has a positive effect on cardiovascular health.



The Differences Between Soluble vs. Insoluble Fiber and Why You Need Both



Even though whey has long been held as the king of all protein supplements, pea protein is rich in essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids, making it a great supplement for muscle building and maintenance, says Nancy Rahnama, M.D., physician and nutrition expert. Science backs it up: Pea protein produced just as much muscle thickness gains in a group of people consuming protein supplements in combination with resistance training as whey, in a study conducted by The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.



In fact, when it comes to the digestion of whey vs. pea protein, pea protein may even have a leg up: ""Pea protein may be better tolerated than whey protein, as it does not have any dairy in it,"" says Dr. Rahnama. If you're one of many people who experience bloating (or stinky protein farts) after downing some whey protein, pea might be a better option for you, she says.



""Another benefit of pea protein is that plant-based diets have been linked to a number of health benefits,"" says Lauren Manaker, registered dietitian. This means lower cholesterol, lower hemoglobin A1c levels (a measure of your average blood sugar level), and better blood glucose control, she explains. Indeed, pea protein may help reduce blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels, according to a study conducted by the University of Michigan Frankel Cardiovascular Center.


   Is Pea Protein a Complete Protein?  

""The obvious downside of pea protein is that it does not have a complete profile of 100 percent of the amino acids you need,"" says Chelsey Schneider, oncology-certified dietitian. FYI, amino acids are the building blocks of protein. While your body can make some of them, you need to consume others through food, she says. Those are called essential amino acids, of which there are nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Animal-based proteins (meat, fish, or dairy) typically contain all these essential amino acids and are therefore called complete proteins, she explains.



Some plant foods (such as quinoa) contain all essential amino acids, but most (such as pea protein) do not, and thus are not complete proteins, says Schneider. An easy fix? Combine different plant-based protein sources that have complementary amino acids to ensure you get all the ones you need. For example, Schneider recommends adding in extras such as chia, flax, or hemp seeds.



10 High-Protein Plant-Based Foods That Are Easy to Digest



If you're on a low-carb diet (such as the keto diet), heads up: ""Peas are an okay source of protein, but it's also a bit high in carbs for a vegetable,"" says Vanessa Rissetto, registered dietitian. One cup of peas has about 8 grams of protein and 21 grams of carbs, she says. This is a drastic difference compared to broccoli, which only has 10 grams of carbs and 2.4 grams of protein per cup.


   How to Pick the Best Pea Protein Powder  

To make sure you're buying a quality pea protein, get one that's organic, says Tara Allen, registered nutritionist. That ensures it'll be non-GMO and will contain fewer pesticides.



You should also check your nutrition labels carefully, as you'll want to choose a brand with the least number of ingredients, she says. Keep an eye out for and avoid excess fillers (such as carrageenan), added sugar, dextrin or maltodextrin, thickeners (such as xanthan gum), and any artificial colorings, she says.



""When looking for a high-quality pea protein powder, it's also wise to avoid artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium,"" says Britni Thomas, registered dietitian. Stevia, on the other hand, is a safe sweetener unless you are sensitive to it, she says.



Although peas aren't a complete protein on their own, many brands will add the missing amino acids or blend pea protein with other plant-based proteins to create a complete protein supplement: Check the right-hand side of the nutrition label on the bottle and make sure that all nine essential amino acids are listed, says Dr. Rahnama.



Regardless of what kind of protein you're using, remember: It's still important to consume protein as part of balanced meals throughout the day. ""It's always best to get as much of your nutrition as possible from whole foods and just utilize supplements to fill in the gaps,"" says Allen. ""There are many ways you can incorporate pea protein into your day."" Try mixing it into smoothies, healthy muffins, oatmeal, and even pancakes.

Artigo 1,"


Full disclosure: I'm one of those annoying people who got into working out over quarantine. After years of half-hearted gym pursuits abandoned after a mere month or two, I finally found a program I liked and stuck with it. With this new workout obsession, though, came others: tracking my macros, monitoring my activity through a shiny new Apple Watch, and changing my eating habits to complement my goals. This introduced me to the wide world of protein powders — the exploration of which has been a ride all of its own.



As a vegetarian who's focused on building muscle, I quickly became aware that I'd need to find ways to add protein to my diet other than eating obscene amounts of peanut butter and hummus. After a little Google search, I discovered whey, a protein made from milk that's easily digestible (unless you have a lactose or dairy allergy, in which case you should avoid it). Upon a little more research, I decided whey protein powder would most benefit my diet and fitness goals. Why exactly? Apparently whey protein can limit muscle breakdown and help with muscle repair and rebuilding, especially when consumed within 60 minutes of your workout, Heidi Skolnik, a New Jersey-based sports nutritionist, previously told Shape.



Hoping for the best, I somewhat hesitantly bought the smallest bag of whey protein powder I could find. That hoping must have worked, because the first one I tried ended up being the one I've liked most. Enter: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder in double rich chocolate (Buy It, from $52, walmart.com), my absolute favorite protein powder. (

After trying other powders, I can confidently say that Optimum Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate is the best-tasting protein — at least in my opinion. The thought of drinking it actually helps me power through my workout, knowing that I'll get to reward myself at the end. It tastes like a super rich chocolate milk with maybe a hint of brownie, and it has no chemical-y or gross aftertaste. Mixing it in a shaker bottle with oat milk is simply divine.



Not only is it delicious, but it's also seriously filling, too. I've learned not to make the mistake of drinking it too close to dinnertime, because otherwise it ruins my appetite. And I can feel confident knowing I'm putting a high-quality formula in my body. FYI, when shopping for protein powder,your best bet is to look for whey protein isolate — not concentrate — as it contains the highest protein concentration (90 to 95 percent) and very little fat, according to Skolnik. This particular protein powder has a blend of both, but contains more isolate than concentrate, which makes it a solid choice. Per scoop, it also has only 1g of sugar, 25g protein, and over 5g of branched-chain amino acids (aka BCAAs, a group of three essential amino acids — building blocks of protein — that are super important for muscle growth and fitness performance). Meaning, it more than supplements my otherwise low-protein diet. (

I'm not the only one who's obsessed with the protein's unbelievable taste and quality. Walmart shoppers who've reviewed it say that it's the best protein powder they've tasted, and that it helps build muscle without causing bloating. (Worth noting: The lactose in whey protein powders can sometimes cause digestive issues, such as bloating, cramping, and diarrhea, especially in people who are lactose intolerant.) One reviewer even said that they switched from their usual go-to brand after trying Optimum Nutrition, and haven't looked back since.



Even though I started with a 1-pound bag, it didn't take me long to upgrade to the 5-pound tub. I've shopped around for various other protein powders, but none have lived up to Optimum Nutrition. Normally, the 5-pound jug can be found on other retail sites for $60, but it's discounted to $52 at Walmart right now. And, if you're not a huge chocolate fan, you can also snap up the same powder in a vanilla ice cream flavor — which I can only believe tastes just as delicious, and like a vanilla milkshake.(



Unflavored Protein Powder You Can Add to Anything and Everything



You were warned: When you try Optimum Nutrition's delicious Gold Standard Whey Protein Powder, you may never search for another protein powder again.

Artigo 2,"


With their tender, fluffy-as-a-cloud texture, ever-so-sweet flavor profile, and ability to be topped with whatever fixings your heart desires, pancakes could easily be deemed a flawless breakfast food. But flapjacks have one pitfall that keeps them from earning the accolade: All of their refined carbs and added sugar can leave you crashing by 11 a.m., not ready to conquer all the errands, workouts, and Netflix binges you had planned for the day.



Lucky for you and your undeniable comfort-food cravings, protein-packed pancake mixes allow you to consume all the buttery goodness of your favorite breakfast food without needing to lie down for a nap just an hour later. While Kodiak Cakes Power Cakes (Buy It, $17 for 3 boxes, amazon.com) is the clear fan-favorite in the baking mix department, holding a spot as one the best-selling pancake mixes on Amazon, it's not necessarily the best for your wallet. Sure, the mix nails the flavor of a classic buttermilk flapjack you'd get at a hole-in-the-wall diner and offers 14 grams of protein per serving. But at $6 a pop, it's hard to justify spending the extra cash when a box of generic mix (Buy It, $4, amazon.com) will satisfy that hot cake hankering for less than half the cost per ounce, even if it doesn't have a hearty dose of protein.



Now, you can have the best of both worlds with this copycat Kodiak pancake mix. Crafted by Jessica Penner, R.D., this DIY Kodiak pancake mix is nearly an exact replica of the OG mix, containing the same oat flour, whole wheat flour, whey protein, buttermilk powder, and a few other ingredients that make the flapjacks fluffy and fill you up.



And by copying the ingredients nearly to a T, Penner was able to create a protein pancake mix that boasts the same nutritional qualities as Kodiak's version. One serving of the copycat mix provides 14 grams of protein and 3 grams of sugar (just like the boxed Kodiak pancake mix) and it contains just one additional gram of carbs, five more calories, and one less gram of fiber than the real deal, according to Penner.



In terms of picking a protein powder, Penner recommends using an unflavored whey protein isolate (Buy It, $27, amazon.com) in your protein pancake mix rather than whey protein concentrate to get the highest amount of protein per serving and ensure there are no unnecessary extra sweeteners, flavors, or fillers added to the mix. Plus, whey protein isolate has a super mild flavor on its own, meaning you can easily incorporate it into any treat, she says. While you can use flavored protein isolates, such as this chocolate variety (Buy It, $25, amazon.com), in the mix, doing so may amp up the sweetness, so consider cutting down on the sugar in the recipe, adds Penner. And if you're sensitive to whey or want to use plant-based protein powder (Buy It, $27, amazon.com) instead, it is possible to include it in the pancake mix; however, you might be dumping those aforementioned additives into the mix, so you may have to adjust how much sugar you use. (BTW, this easy pancake recipe is egg-, dairy-, and gluten-free.)



More good news: All this protein comes with health benefits. Noshing on protein at breakfast makes you feel full faster and for a longer period of time than when you consume it at lunch or dinner, according to a study published in the International Journal of Obesity. Plus, consuming a breakfast with high-protein and low-glycemic-load foods (think: rolled oats and whole grains) is linked with higher levels of energy, and whey protein boosts satiety more than other types of protein, according to a 2011 study. Translation: This protein pancake mix will ensure your stomach doesn't scream for a snack and second cup of coffee right after breakfast.



Instead of settling for a protein-free mix or repeatedly shelling out the extra dough to buy a fancy one at the grocery store every other week, whip up a big-batch of Penner's copycat Kodiak pancake mix. Not only will you save money in the long run, but you'll be able to have protein-packed pancakes on demand — and yes, it's totally acceptable to eat them for dinner.

Artigo 3,"


With some things in life, the more flavor the better: personalities, your sex life, salsa verde. When it comes to protein powder, however, the benefit of added flavor is debatable. Some people love a burst of sweetness, others find it unnecessary and too overpowering.



Enter: unflavored protein powder, a convenient way to amp up your protein intake if you prefer to avoid sweeteners. Here's the scoop (pun intended) on flavorless protein powder, including how to use it in recipes and the best options to buy. (



Is It Better to Drink a Protein Shake Before or After a Workout?


   What Is Unflavored Protein Powder?  

Unflavored protein powder is exactly what it sounds like—with a caveat. ""Unflavored means that no flavorings are added,"" says Amy Shapiro, M.S., R.D., C.D.N., founder of Real Nutrition. ""For most protein powders, that means they are not adding any additional flavors or sweeteners. It does depend on the brand though, as some brands add additional ingredients to improve texture and taste. It is important to read nutrition labels and not just accept what is stated on the front of the package."" The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate dietary supplements as strictly as it does medication, and companies can label a powder ""unflavored"" when it actually contains added flavor ingredients.



The main advantage of using unflavored protein powder is that it (typically) doesn't contain sweeteners. Avoiding sweeteners can be a matter of taste—a lot of people find ingredients like stevia to taste overly sweet—or it can be a health-focused choice. ""Some sweeteners, such as sucralose, are not healthy regardless of the fact that they're calorie-free, and others may cause stomach upset or bloating,"" says Shapiro.


   How to Use Unflavored Protein Powder  

Once you're familiar with how much protein you should eat in a day, you can start getting creative with your recipes. Smoothies and shakes are the obvious choices, but you're not limited to sweet drinks when it comes to adding a scoop (or two) of protein powder. Because unflavored protein powder isn't sweet, it's more versatile. While you'd probably never dream of sprinkling Fruity Pebbles-flavored protein powder into a savory recipe, unflavored protein powder is more neutral. Garlic bread, fried chicken, homemade pasta…the possibilities are endless.



Keep in mind that just because it's flavorless doesn't mean it tastes like air. Rather, unflavored protein powder tends to have a bit of a nutty taste and/or grainy texture—both of which can easily be masked with ingredients such as nut butters, fruits, cacao, or herbs if you're not a fan. If you're skeptical, Shapiro recommends adding small amounts of the powder (even a quarter-scoop at first) and increasing the amounts until you're used to the flavor. (



The Best Protein Powders for Women, According to Nutritionists





   Where to Buy Unflavored Protein Powder  

You could spend hours comparing the many protein powders available, even if you've narrowed your search down to unflavored options. It'll help if you know what to look out for. To choose one of the best unflavored protein powder options, Shapiro suggests keeping the following in mind:



The best options use organic, minimally-processed, and well-sourced ingredients. ""By well-sourced I mean making sure it is grass-fed, lead-free, made from clean ingredients from trusted manufacturers and farms, etc.,"" says Shapiro. (You'll probably have to do some digging on the company's own website.)
Double check on the ingredient list that it only contains the type of protein(s) you're intending to consume (whey, pea, etc.).
Avoid soy additions like soy lecithin. Soy is inflammatory for many people and the form in powders tends to be highly processed, says Shapiro.
Some brands rely heavily on fillers and emulsifiers, which are ingredients that enhance texture and prevent clumping. (Carrageenan, maltodextrin, and lecithin are some common examples.) Err on the side of a short ingredient list and a high amount of protein per serving. Keep in mind vegan protein sources are automatically going to be lower in protein by volume compared to animal-based protein.



With that all in mind, here are some of the best unflavored protein powders:

Whey is considered a high-quality protein since it contains all nine essential amino acids—the building blocks of protein—and tends to be easier on the stomach (unless, of course, you're sensitive to dairy). This tasteless whey protein powder only contains two ingredients: whey protein isolate (which contains a higher protein concentration than whey concentrate) from grass-fed cows and sunflower lecithin. And it's relatively inexpensive, which certainly doesn't hurt.

Most people with muscle-building goals are not strangers to protein-infused variations of traditional snacks. After all, recipe ideas from protein pudding to protein cookie dough are all the rage on TikTok and Instagram alike. It should come as no surprise, then, that protein chips have hit the market, promising a chip alternative for those who want in on the benefits of protein.



Shaped like tortilla chips and flavor-dusted like Doritos, these chips pack a significant amount of protein in a single-serving bag. Ahead, learn more about protein chips, including whether or not they are actually healthy, who should try them, and the potential benefits of adding the crunchy crisps into your diet.


   What Are Protein Chips, Exactly?  

Protein chips are exactly what you think you are: A bite-sized snack that contains more protein than a regular ol' bag of chips, explains strength and conditioning coach Reda Elmardi, R.D., C.S.C.S., founder of The Gym Goat. Available in supplement stores and fitness facilities, protein chips are significantly higher in protein than the chips you'd typically find in a sandwich shop or cafeteria. For comparison, one serving of protein chips contains roughly 10 to 19 grams of protein, depending on the brand. A bag of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, however, contains 2 grams of protein.



Exactly what these chips taste like varies from brand to brand and flavor to flavor. Quest chips, a popular option, are available in loaded taco, nacho cheese, and cheddar and sour cream flavors, to name a few. NutriWise, Wholesome Provisions, ProteinWise, and PopCorners all make varieties of protein chips.






   Are Protein Chips Healthy?  

Gone are the days of putting foods into the black and white categories of ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy."" Ultimately, whether or not something is healthy depends on how much you're eating and your individual needs, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, R.D.N., creator of the site Better Than Dieting and author of Read It Before You Eat It.



For starters, ""any chip can be integrated into a healthy diet,"" says Taub-Dix. ""It depends on how much you're eating."" When it comes to your health, moderation is key, she says.



Second, protein chips may be a better choice than some other snack options, but worse than others, depending on your overall diet. If, for example, you are a person who struggles to get an adequate amount of protein in your diet, protein chips are certainly a healthier option than a bag of Doritos, which have around one-tenth the amount of protein. (For reference, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that those on a 2,000-calorie diet consume 46 grams of protein per day.) However, protein chips don't have anywhere near the micronutrient content of a fruit salad or veggie tray, so if you already get enough protein but need to consume more vitamins and minerals, there are better options.



It's helpful to focus on whether your overall relationship with food is healthy. Having a healthy relationship with food can mean viewing foods (e.g. protein chips) as a source of nutrients and comfort, rather than feeling shame and guilt around your choices, as Shape previously reported.


   The Benefits Of Protein Chips  

Protein chips offer several nutrition perks, mainly thanks to — you guessed it — their protein content.


  May Support Post-Workout Recovery  

Following a workout, especially strength training, your body needs a combination of protein and carbohydrates to support muscle recovery. Why? During your workout, your body taps into stored glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in your muscles for energy, explains Taub-Dix. Assuming you went hard, after you've taken that last stride and cranked that last rep, your muscles are zapped of glycogen and littered with microtears, she says.



A post-workout snack complete with carbs and protein helps replenish your muscles of that glycogen and also gives your muscles the tools they need to repair. Your body can break the protein down into little building blocks called amino acids, which help repair torn muscle fibers much like Gorilla Glue repairs a broken chair, explains Taub-Dix.



Note, many nutrition experts believe that the optimal post-workout snack delivers carbohydrates and protein in a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1, which most protein chips do not have. ""These protein chips have protein but very, very little carbohydrates,"" notes Taub-Dix. Quest Nutrition BBQ Protein Chips, for instance, have 19 grams of protein but just 5 grams of carbs. So, you'd be wise to pair the chips with a carb-dense snack such as a banana, dried mango, or toast to maximize post-workout recovery, says Taub-Dix.


  Supports Important Body Functions  

To be clear, you need protein even if you don't work out. Protein helps keep your blood sugar levels stable, makes and regulates hormones, and supports wound repair, says Taub-Dix. ""Inadequate protein intake can lead to skin, hair, and nail problems, increased risk of injury, and delayed healing, and generalized weakness and fatigue,"" says Elmardi.



As for how much protein you need, experts generally recommend consuming around .75 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight if you're active and no less than .5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight if you're sedentary, as Shape previously reported. So if you weigh in at 200 pounds, that means you should aim to consume somewhere from 100 to 150 grams of protein per day.



The 20 grams of protein you get from protein chips may not sound like a significant contribution to that total daily intake, but in reality, it is, according to Taub-Dix. ""For a sense of just how much protein that really is, you need to consider that that's about the same amount of protein in a 3-ounce chicken cutlet or three eggs,"" she says.


  Can Support Weight Maintenance Goals  

If you need to lose weight or are trying to maintain a healthy weight, protein chips could be a good snack option for you, according to Elmardi. They offer a similar texture and flavor profile to other chips, but contain more vitamins, minerals, and protein. And because ""they have protein in them, they're also going to be more filling compared to other chips and crunchy snacks,"" says Elmardi. If you're full, you're less likely to consume additional servings or snacks, a move that can contribute to weight maintenance goals.


   Who Should and Shouldn't Eat Protein Chips?  

Protein chips are primarily marketed to meatheads and snack queens. But ultimately, anyone who is paying extra attention to their daily protein intake or who's partial to crunchy snacks might enjoy the chips.



It's worth noting that there are a number of dietary restrictions that could make protein chips a poor choice for certain people. Many of these protein chips (Wholesome Provisions and Quest chips, for example), get their protein from whey protein isolate, which is a milk product. ""Whey protein isolate is going to be a problem for anyone who is lactose intolerant,"" says Taub-Dix. ""Even someone with a mild milk intolerance could wind up spending the day in the bathroom after eating a bag."" The whey protein isolate in many protein chip options means they're also unsuitable for vegans who can't eat animal-based products.



If you need to avoid milk and milk products for whatever reason, look for a plant-based protein chip, says Taub-Dix. PopCorners Flex Protein Crisps, for example, are a plant-based option that gets their protein from soy protein concentrate. Meanwhile, WonderSlim Pea Protein Chips get their protein from pea protein. Just keep in mind that both of these plant-based options contain just 10 grams of protein — while that's still a significant amount of protein compared to the standard chip, it's about half the amount of protein of other protein chips.



All things considered, protein chips can make a healthy addition to your diet, particularly if you find it difficult to consume enough protein each day. If your main concern is to find a snack option that's portable, salty, and crunchy, it can fill that need too.

If the fitness and health industry had a mascot, protein powder would be it. The supplement is popular among active people, both athletes and casual exercisers alike. Protein powder is also touted as a must-have supplement for myriad goals, including weight loss, weight gain, and muscle maintenance.



However, if you're new to the complex world of supplements, you might wonder if protein powder is something you actually need. To help you out, we asked registered dietitians for the 411 on this supplement. Ahead, experts explain the potential benefits and risks of protein powder, plus how to figure out if you need protein powder at all.


   What is Protein?  

Protein is an essential macronutrient, meaning the body needs it in large amounts. (The other macronutrients are carbohydrates and fats, ICYDK.) According to the National Library of Medicine, protein is made of building blocks called amino acids, and there are 20 that humans use. Eleven of those amino acids are non-essential, meaning the body can make them on its own, says registered dietitian Linzy Ziegelbaum, M.S., R.D., C.D.N. The remaining nine—known as essential amino acids—aren't produced by the body, so we need to get them via food.



According to Ziegelbaum, amino acids are involved in many functions in the body. Examples include immune function, metabolism, muscle building and repair, and hormone regulation. Amino acids also give structural support to body tissues, provide energy, and maintain digestive function. In other words, amino acids are pretty darn important.







Animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs contain all nine essential amino acids, so they're known as ""complete"" sources of protein, says Victoria Whittington, R.D.N., a registered dietitian at Atlas Optimization. Meanwhile, certain plant foods—think grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds—contain some, but not all, essential amino acids, earning them the title ""incomplete"" proteins. (There are several exceptions, like soy and quinoa, which are complete proteins.)



It's totally possible to get all the amino acids you need by combining different plant-based proteins, says Whittington. This is helpful if you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, or if you're simply trying to nosh on more plants.


   What is Protein Powder?  

Protein powder is a powdered form of protein sourced from animals or plants. It's a nutritional supplement, so it's not meant to be a main source of protein. Instead, it's meant to be added to your existing diet to bolster your protein intake. Because protein powder can include anywhere between 10 to 30 grams of protein per scoop, it can be especially useful if you eat little to no animal products, says Whittington.



There also are different types of protein powder that vary by source. The most common animal-based proteins are whey and casein, which are both derived from milk, says Whittington. ""Whey protein is a byproduct of the cheese-making process. [To make it,] enzymes are added to separate the curd from the liquid whey, [which] is then pasteurized."" This isolates the whey, which is dried into a powder. Casein is made from the curd of milk, which goes through a separation process that isolates the protein. Both whey and casein are complete sources of protein (meaning they contain all 9 essential amino acids).



Plant-based protein powder is often derived from soy, brown rice, pea, or hemp—but it can also come from foods like watermelon seeds, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds. In general, the powder is made by extracting protein from the plant source, which is then processed and milled.



According to Whittington, most plant-based powders contain a blend of plant proteins to provide all the essential amino acids you need. Many versions contain soy, as it's one of the few plant-based complete proteins—but you can certainly find soy-free versions on the market, too.


   Benefits of Protein Powder  

Because protein powder can be sourced from a variety of animal or plant foods, the exact benefits of a specific protein powder can vary greatly. Still, when it comes to protein powder in general, the supplement has been shown to have myriad health benefits.


  Increased Satiety  

Protein increases feelings of fullness because it takes longer to digest, says Whittington. It also reduces ghrelin—a hormone that promotes hunger—and increases peptide YY (a hormone that promotes satiety), she adds.



When you add protein powder to a meal or snack, research shows it can keep you satisfied for a longer time. This could help reduce hunger in between meals, which can be a lifesaver on busy days. Additionally, if losing or maintaining weight is on your health to-do list, the increased feeling of fullness can help decrease overall caloric intake throughout the day, says Whittington.


  Muscle Building  

If protein powder had a claim to fame, building muscle would be it. More specifically, it helps recover and grow muscle after exercise, resulting in increased muscle mass. Here's how it works.



During physical activity, muscle tissue breaks down, says Ziegelbaum. But, specific exercises (think weighted biceps curls or barbell squats) cause muscles to grow. In fact, research shows resistance training in particular stimulates the synthesis of muscle protein (aka muscle growth). Supplementing with protein enhances this growth effect, as the amino acids trigger the production of muscle tissue. Amino acids found in protein powder also serve as structural components of the actual muscle, helping repair the tissue. (BTW: To maximize these effects, Ziegelbaum suggests consuming protein or protein powder 30 minutes to one hour after physical activity.)


  Muscle Maintenance  

Another benefit of protein powder is muscle maintenance. This is undoubtedly important for athletes, but non-athletes can also benefit from this perk. Unfortunately, muscle mass naturally decreases with age. A 2019 study shows this can increase the risk of falls and reduced mobility—so much so that muscle strength has a strong correlation with the chances of disability in older folks. However, consuming more protein can help slow down muscle loss, especially when paired with strength training twice a week.



That's where protein powder comes in. According to a 2019 scientific review, the combo of strength training and protein supplements can help improve muscle strength and mobility in older adults. Another 2022 review found similar results, noting that protein supplements can decrease the risk of sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss. Meanwhile, a 2021 study found that six months of whey, soy, or whey-soy protein supplementation helped maintain lean muscle and physical function in older adults.


   Side Effects and Risks of Protein Powder  

When it comes to adding protein powder to your eating plan, there tend to be few risks. ""Most healthy individuals can consume protein powder without any side effects or risks,"" says Whittington. However, as with many supplements, it's possible to overdo it. Taking too much can cause gas and bloating, particularly if you have a dairy sensitivity and consume whey or casein.



Also, if you have an allergy to an ingredient in a protein powder (like soy or milk, for example), you can develop an allergic reaction. The signs of a food allergy are different for each person, but common ones include stomach cramps, wheezing, coughing, trouble swallowing, and dizziness.



In general, healthy folks can consume protein powder without worrying about kidney damage, says Whittington. But if you have pre-existing kidney disease, a high intake of protein may cause complications, so you may need to limit protein (from powder or otherwise), she adds. To be safe, if you have a kidney condition or another chronic disease, speak with a healthcare provider before taking protein powder—or any new supplement, for that matter.


   How to Use Protein Powder  

Protein powder is super user-friendly, as it's easy to add to things you already eat and drink. It's typically blended into smoothies or with liquid, such as dairy or plant-based milk, to make protein shakes. You can also sprinkle it into coffee, yogurt, oatmeal, chia pudding, or cereal. Unflavored iterations work well in savory preparations—such as chili or soup—while flavored versions are particularly tasty in pancakes, waffles, and baked goods.



Here's the tricky part: There's no overall recommended daily intake of protein powder. That's because protein needs are different for each person, says Ziegelbaum. The amount is calculated based on many factors, including age, weight, activity level, and health goals. Plus, protein powder is meant to supplement an existing diet, so your ideal daily intake depends on how much protein you're already eating.



That said, the recommended daily allowance for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, which is the minimum amount you need to meet basic nutrition needs and prevent protein deficiency. You can calculate your daily protein requirement (in grams) by multiplying your weight (in pounds) by 0.36.



But again, that's the amount needed for basic health. If you're an athlete looking to build muscle, you'll likely need closer to 1.1 or 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. The best way to figure out your exact protein requirement is to chat with a registered dietitian. They can determine the amount of protein you need based on your personal factors and lifestyle, including how much protein powder you should take per day, if at all. As Ziegelbaum explains, you might not need protein powder if you're meeting your protein requirements through food. Perhaps it's a great option for you on-the-go or an easy way to add variety.



How Much Protein You Should Eat Per Day — Plus, High-Protein Meal Ideas to Try


   The Bottom Line  

From increased satiety to enhanced muscle growth, protein powder has an impressive list of health benefits. It also doesn't hurt that the supplement can be sourced from both animals and plants, making it easy to add to different diets. Plus, protein powder is generally well-tolerated, though taking too much can cause gastrointestinal issues like bloating and gas.



Despite its benefits, protein powder is not something everyone needs, says Ziegelbaum. Depending on your current diet, you might already be getting enough protein for your personal needs and lifestyle. Alternatively, if you're having trouble meeting your protein needs via food, a protein powder could help you meet the mark, says Ziegelbaum. A registered dietitian is the best person to determine if you need protein powder, and if so, how much to take each day.

Most folks can agree that bread is one of life's simplest (and greatest) pleasures, guaranteed to lift your spirits when you're feeling glum and soothe your growling stomach when dinner's not quite ready yet. It's crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and chock-full of comforting, energizing carbohydrates. What's not to love?



For some people, it's bread's meager protein content. Refresher: Protein is a macronutrient that helps build and repair cells, tissue, and muscle; ensures proper growth and development; and assists in body processes such as blood clotting, fluid balance, and more, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. To keep your body functioning properly, the United States Department of Agriculture recommends adults stick to a 2,000-calorie diet to score at least 46 grams of the macronutrient each day. A slice of standard white bread offers only about two grams of protein (or 4 percent of the recommended dietary allowance), however. So, sandwich lovers and toast fanatics might wish their favorite breads had higher protein contents to make hitting that suggested intake a breeze — without needing to pile lean turkey sky-high between the slices. (BTW, this guide will help you figure out exactly how much protein your own body needs on the daily.)



Enter: High-protein bread. Here, a registered dietitian gives the lowdown on the protein-packed baked good, including what to look for in a loaf and how to decide if it deserves a spot in your pantry.






   What Is High-Protein Bread?  

What makes one bread higher in protein than another typically comes down to its whole grain content, says Abby Chan, M.S., R.D.N., a registered dietitian nutritionist and the co-owner of EVOLVE Flagstaff in Arizona. ICYDK, whole grains have three parts: the bran (the fiber-rich outer layer that boasts iron and B vitamins), the endosperm (the middle layer that offers carbs and some protein), and the germ (the core that provides healthy fats, vitamin E, and B vitamins), according to the Harvard School of Public Health. When a grain is processed, however, the bran and germ are removed, stripping it of those key micronutrients and removing at least a quarter of its protein content, according to the Whole Grains Council. That's why a standard slice of a whole wheat loaf offers about 30 percent more protein than a piece made with refined white flour, according to the USDA.



Some bread contains seeds, such as flax, chia, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds, which help up the protein content, too. ""There's definitely going to be more nutrients in those breads,"" says Chan. ""It's going to be higher in protein because overall seeds are a great source of plant-based protein, and then it's going to have higher amounts of nutrients like magnesium or zinc, depending on the seed."" The cherry on top: extra fiber, particularly the soluble kind that can help lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels, according to the Mayo Clinic.



Nowadays, breadmakers are also getting a bit more creative with their recipes. ""High-protein everything is so market-worthy that there are now companies that are adding other proteins into their bread, such as pea protein or whey protein, to increase that protein content,"" says Chan. ""Typically, they're adding an external protein source into, like, a white bread."" Along with protein, these loaves are often fortified with the nutrients lost during processing (think: iron, B vitamins), she explains. Even with those additives, this variety of high-protein bread typically falls short on fiber, a nutrient that helps keep you feeling full and your number twos regular, she adds. (



What's the Difference Between Whole Wheat and Whole Grain?


   Who Should Eat High-Protein Bread?  

While high-protein bread often provides a few good-for-you nutrients that aren't found in traditional white sandwich loaves, there's nothing wrong with eating a baguette or a similar style of bread if and when you please, says Chan. In order to decide which type to add to your plate, Chan suggests asking yourself what you're hoping to get out of your bread in the first place. Are you craving a thick slice of fresh-baked, crusty sourdough? A seedy, whole grain-rich bread probably isn't going to satisfy your hankering. But if you're in need of a sandwich bread that'll help tide you over until your next meal, a high-protein bread may be a better option, she says.



Even if you do need to make a filling meal out of a piece or two of bread, you don't have to turn to the higher-protein — and typically more expensive — loaves, says Chan. ""If you don't want to pay the exorbitant price for bread with added protein or you're someone who just prefers white bread, you can stack that easily with a few eggs or put some nut butter or seed butter on it to help beef that [protein] up so it's a little bit more of a substantial meal,"" she says.


   What to Look for In High-Protein Bread  

If you decide to give high-protein bread a shot, Chan recommends checking out a loaf's fiber content before adding it to your cart. ""I generally look for something that has two to three, if not more, grams of fiber in it,"" she says. ""That fiber's going to help keep you full and slow down digestion a little bit."" Similarly, consider opting for a bread that has minimal added sugars — sugars added to food that provide little nutritional value and are typically used to make commercially baked goods more palatable, says Chan. The USDA recommends adults following 2,000-calorie diets cap their intake of added sugars at 50 grams a day, so consider the other sources of added sugar you're eating throughout the day to guide your choice of bread and stay under that suggested limit. (This guide will help you decode your bread's nutrition label.)



When you're tight on cash, skip the loaves with added whey or pea proteins and instead go for a whole grain-based bread, which is generally more economical and still packs plenty of protein and those essential nutrients (think: vitamin E, iron, B vitamins, fiber), suggests Chan. To spend less time browsing the bread aisle, consider picking up one of Chan's top picks, below, the next time you're at the supermarket.


  The Best High-Protein Bread Options, According to a Nutritionist  

Dave's Killer Bread Organic 21 Whole Grains and Seed Bread 



Packed with nearly two dozen types of whole grains and seeds — including oats, spelt, millet, quinoa, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and more — this loaf offers five grams of protein and five grams of fiber per slice. Note: The high-protein bread also contains five grams of added sugar (or 10 percent of the USDA's suggested limit), so keep that in mind while planning out your eats for the rest of the day.

  Food For Life Ezekiel 4:9 Organic Frozen Sprouted Grain Bread  

Unlike other loaves, this high-protein bread is found in the freezer aisle. The bread is made from organic grains and legumes, including wheat, barley, millet, lentils, soybeans, and spelt that has been sprouted (read: germinated), which increases the bioavailability of soluble fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, according to an article published by Penn State University's College of Agricultural Sciences. Nosh on a slice, and you'll score five grams of protein and three grams of fiber. Just make sure to toast the bread first, suggests Chan, to give it a satisfyingly crispy texture.

Though these high-protein bread loaves and others like them will help you get one step closer to reaching your protein goals for the day, remember that they're far from a necessity. ""If you're eating bread because you just need something really delicious, then don't worry about the protein content,"" says Chan. ""You don't need to buy a high-protein, enriched bread."" Still, higher-protein, whole grain-based bread does come with a few health benefits that white loaves may not offer, including improved digestion from the fiber and muscle gains from the protein. When in doubt, just choose the type of loaf that makes you feel your best. (Next up: These Dietitian-Approved, High-Protein Snacks Will Keep You from Getting Hangry)

Where were you before you knew smoothies existed? These meals in a cup can get a bad rap for their high sugar content and weak macros, but when blended right, you can make your smoothie work for whatever your health goal.



""Blending is one of the quickest, easiest ways to prep healthy foods, especially fresh fruits and veggies,"" says Harley Pasternak, trainer, nutrition expert, and author of the book The Body Reset Diet.



Keep reading for some of his favorite weight-loss smoothie recipes and other protein shake recipes for weight loss, plus details on how all of the above can kick-start your metabolism and keep it fired up for hours.


   How to Make the Best Weight-Loss Smoothie  

Here are the four things you need to create your own tasty, healthy weight-loss smoothies. (Visual learner? See our infographic formula for how to build a stellar smoothie.)



Liquid Base: Pasternak favors dairy milk (1 percent or nonfat) because it's rich in vitamin D and calcium, which can help your body break down fat. But non-dairy alternative milk, like soy and almond, are fine too, he says, as is flavored water.
Lean Protein: Getting protein at every meal helps you maintain lean muscle mass, which means you burn more calories throughout the day. (Here's how to determine how much protein your body needs every day.) Your best bets: plain nonfat yogurt, silken tofu, or unflavored protein powder.
Healthy Fats: These give you energy, make your protein shake for weight loss actually satisfying, plus help your body absorb vitamins. Use up to two tablespoons of an ingredient that contains the good—that is, monounsaturated—kind, like avocado, seeds, or nuts. 
High-Fiber Carbs: Any fruit will do, but raspberries and blueberries deliver the most fiber and the least amount of sugar. As for veggies, spinach and cucumber have the mildest, easiest-to-mask flavors.







Put the liquid in first, then add the solid ingredients, and blend until smooth. Depending on how thick you like your weight-loss smoothies—and how powerful your blender or food processor is—you may need to thin these out with a little liquid, such as nonfat milk.

If you've been to the freezer section of your grocery store lately, then you're probably aware that multiple brands offer high-protein ice cream alternatives. But if you're looking to save money or recreate your favorite flavor by making protein ice cream at home, TikTok has got you covered. Users have been sharing their easy protein ice cream recipes that come together in minutes. Now that the topic has attracted over 80 million views on the app, it's clear that the tasty trend is here to stay.



Below, how to get in on the action — plus a dietitian's take on the nutrition of protein ice cream.


   How to Make Protein Ice Cream  

The wonderful thing about high-protein ice cream is that you can improvise based on your preferences and what you have on hand. Most of the recipes include a cup or less of your nut milk of choice as a base, along with ice, frozen fruit, or other sweet add-ins (including Oreos, whipped cream, pudding mix, even cereal). Obviously, you'll also add a source of protein — TikTokers love adding flavored protein powder, flavored Greek yogurt, or powdered peanut butter. (



Yogurt Toast Is TikTok's New Breakfast Obsession



To make your protein ice cream of choice, you'll need a high-powered blender or food processor. The key ingredient that many TikTok creators rely on to give the chilled treat an ice cream-like texture is xanthan gum, a thickening and stabilizing agent commonly found in traditional ice cream, as well as in salad dressings, baked goods, syrups, soups, etc. It's also commonly found in protein powders, which is why you'll only need to add about a teaspoon to your protein ice cream.







Need some inspiration? You'll find plenty of variations of the dessert on TikTok, including @my.getfit's protein ice cream recipe, which uses a scoop of whey protein powder, 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum, 1 teaspoon of sugar-free pudding mix and a zero-calorie sweetener of choice, 1/2 cup of your chosen unsweetened cashew or almond milk, and some ice.






TikTok user @haileybirch_health opted for a peanut butter banana version, blending up two to three frozen bananas, a scoop of vanilla protein powder, 2 tablespoons of powdered or regular PB, and a splash of almond milk, with the bananas serving as a replacement for ice. They also added in chocolate chips towards the end of blending for some crunch.





   Nutrition Benefits of High-Protein Ice Cream  

Nothing compares to regular ice cream, but if you want to sneak in some extra protein to stay satiated and support your muscles and bones, rest assured that protein ice cream is an RD-approved method. ""What you are putting in your protein ice cream can make all the difference from a nutrition standpoint,"" says Nicole Lindel, M.S., R.D.N., registered dietitian and Everlywell advisor. ""Using fruit, protein powder, Greek yogurt, and cow or nut milk makes for a delicious, well-balanced snack or meal.""



Eating the right amount of protein each day is essential to support your body's functioning, notes Lindel. ""It's recommended that the average adult have 0.8 to 1.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight,"" she notes. ""However, this really depends on the individual. A variety of factors can contribute, such as age, sex, health, and level of physical activity. Protein is vital to growth and development. Our bodies need protein from the diet to build and maintain bones, muscles, and skin.""



Lindel recommends adding a bit of honey along with ample fruit for natural sweetness. Also, some TikTok commenters have noted digestive issues from xanthan gum (consuming it can lead to abdominal discomfort in some people), but you can omit it or sub in a different thickening ingredient. ""Chia seeds soaked in water are a great substitute for xanthan gum,"" says Lindel. ""This is also a smart addition to protein ice cream because chia seeds are packed with fiber and an array of vital nutrients."" FYI, if you skip these thickening agents altogether, you might end up with a texture that's more smoothie than fro-yo.



And there you have it — all you need is a blender, a few ingredients, and a heaping scoop of creativity, and you're sure to find a frosty, protein-packed combination you'll love. (Up next: 10 TikTok Food Hacks That Actually Work)

If you still think protein powder is only for muscleheads who never leave the weight room, you're sorely behind on the fitness-nutrition times. Protein is an essential macronutrient that helps you recover from tough workouts, build muscle, and stabilize blood sugar so you can maintain good energy. (Here's how much protein you need per day.)



But try as you might, if you're not one to reach for a scoop of whey protein (or soy, brown rice, or casein protein) every time you make a post-workout protein shake, it can be hard to use up those huge tubs of protein powder before the sell-by date. And while you might admit to using things like milk a few days after the carton says it's expired, do the same iffy ""rules"" apply to protein powder?


  Does protein powder go bad after the sell-by date?  

Most likely, it's OK to eat, reassures Robert Wildman, Ph.D., R.D., chief protein officer of Premier Protein. He says that since protein powders are such dry products, there's little risk of bacterial growth or spoilage. What's more, the ""use by"" and ""sell by"" dates listed on packages indicate the food's quality, not safety—meaning, it's safe to consume foods stamped with ""use by"" or ""sell by"" past the date on the label, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).



What can happen to expired protein powder is that it'll stop tasting so great, he says. ""The sell-by date is usually a year or more out, but after a long enough period, the intensity of the flavors can start to fade. It's still safe to eat, but that's when you might want to start cooking with it instead of just adding it to water or milk."" Wildman likes to add it to smoothies, pancakes, muffins, or even sprinkle it over oatmeal. (Unflavored Protein Powder You Can Add to Anything and Everything.)







And while the sell-by date doesn't indicate the safety of the product, he does recommend tossing any protein powder once it's a full year past the sell-by date—just to be on the safe side.


  How can you tell if protein powder has gone bad?  

If you're planning to eat expired protein powder past the sell-by or use-by date, mix up a little in water and do a smell- and taste-test before using it. If it seems rancid or off in any way, trust your nose and ditch it. Ditto if you notice any odd changes in color or texture, or spot some mold.


  How do you preserve protein powder as long as possible?  

To keep your protein powder tasting great for as long as possible, store it in a cool, dry place, like your pantry. And keep it off the top of the fridge; the heat and humidity can cause it to degrade faster, says Wildman. (Wondering which kind of protein powder is best for you? These are the best protein powders for women, according to nutritionists.)

Q: Should I avoid soy protein isolate?



A: Soy has become a very controversial and complicated topic. Historically Asian populations have consumed large amounts of soy products while also having the longest and healthiest lives in the world. Research regarding soy protein and cardiovascular health became so robust that it was awarded a health claim, allowing food companies to state that ""25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of (name of food) provides X grams of soy protein.""



But for every health benefit of this complete plant-based protein source, you'll also hear of a potential detrimental effect, including an increased risk of certain cancers, disturbed hormonal balance, disrupted thyroid function, or intake of pesticides and toxins.



Easing some concerns, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) released a nearly 400-page report on the effects of soy and soy isoflavones (antioxidants found in soy), concluding that, ""For all outcomes, including adverse events, there is no conclusive evidence of a dose-response effect for either soy protein or isoflavone."" However, because soy products come in such a wide variety-whole soy, fermented soy, soy protein isolate, and others-confusion continues to ensue.







6 Satisfying Soy-Free Vegan Smoothies



Soy protein isolate in particular has been increasingly placed under a health microscope regarding its safety, due to its widespread use to increase protein content of various foods or to enhance texture. There are three common concerns to be aware of.



1. Metal contamination. Soy protein isolate is extracted from defatted soy flour. It is made of almost pure protein, since the isolation process yields a product that is 93 to 97 percent protein, leaving minimal fat and carbohydrates. The concern about the isolation process centers on the fact that aluminum found in the giant vats used to isolate the soy protein may leach into the protein itself, increasing the likelihood of heavy-metal poisoning. This is completely speculative, as I have yet to see an analysis of soy, whey, or any protein isolate showing heavy metal contamination from the containers used during the isolation process.



2. Pesticide risk. Ninety percent of genetically modified soy is resistant to glyphosate, the pesticide found in Round Up. A concern raised about eating products with soy protein isolate is that you will consume excessive amounts of this chemical. The good news? Glyphosate is not well absorbed by the human GI tract, the potential negative effects on humans are dose-dependent, and the level of that dose is very controversial.



The other good news (or maybe bad news) is that when it comes to glyphosate, soy protein isolate isn't your main problem. Glyphosate is everywhere, which is the really bad news! It is like BPA, which I've covered previously. Research published in 2014 in Food Chemistry and Environmental & Analytical Toxicology highlighted the fact that the worldwide use of glyphosate has made it abundant in our ambient environment and food supply. While the amount of glyphosate in a serving of soy protein isolate has not been quantified, it is very unlikely soy it is your primary, only, or even a significant source of exposure of this pesticide.



3. Concentrated isoflavones. One of the most controversial areas of soy, isoflavones are antioxidants that are famous for mimicking estrogen in the body. This effect has been seen as a benefit, with research showing that 75 or 54 milligrams a day (mg/d) of soy isoflavones can increase bone mineral density and decrease the frequency and severity of hot flashes, respectively. However, isoflavones in soy have also been proposed to play a role in increasing risk of breast cancer. The research in this area is complicated and constantly evolving, with negative effects seen in animal studies, but no effects found in human studies.



It's also important to note that soy protein isolate isn't necessarily a concentrated source of isoflavones. According to the USDA Isoflavone Database, one ounce (about one scoop) of soy protein isolate contains 28mg soy isoflavones and three ounces of cooked tofu contain 23mg soy isoflavones. On a per-serving basis, both foods contain about the same dose of isoflavones, but soy protein isolate contains significantly more protein: 23g vs. 8g.



All things considered, eating moderate amounts of soy protein isolate does not provide a health risk. I see the main benefit of soy protein isolate as a nutritional tool to help you meet your daily protein needs. If you abstain from eating dairy protein (whey) right after a workout or if you need to increase the protein at a given meal, use soy protein as you would use any protein supplement.

Let me start by saying I'm not a particularly daring person. I hate roller coasters, I definitely will not go skydiving, and my idea of ""adventurous eating"" is ordering sushi. The irony of me recommending Hi! Human Improvement Cricket Protein Powder (Buy It, $12 for a 3-pack, amazon.com) — yes, cricket, as in the actual bug — is not lost on me.



Why cricket-based powder when there are so many insect-free options readily available? Because whey-based protein powders upset my stomach, plant-based protein powders are too grainy, and I can't hop on the bovine collagen train because I avoid eating beef. I was searching for a protein powder that was just right for my gut, taste buds, and personal values, which is how I Goldilocks-ed my way to insects. (



The Best Protein Powders for Women, According to Nutritionists



Two former Starbucks employees were on a similar hunt for a better protein powder, which is how Hi! protein powder came to be. Through extensive research, they discovered that crickets are made of up to 70 percent protein (in both their whole and powder form), making for a surprisingly perfect ingredient. The founders combined cricket powder (which makes up approximately 20 percent of the mixture) with an organic base of brown rice, pumpkin, and pea protein to create their nutritious powder, packed with an impressive 21 grams of protein per 1.4-ounce serving.In contrast, the whey powder sitting in my pantry has just 12 grams for the same serving size.



If you're thinking that's bananas, I have some news for you: cricket powder is actually pretty healthy. ""Cricket powder is very high in certain micronutrients,"" says Joel B. Mason, M.D., a gastroenterologist and professor at Tufts University Schools of Medicine. Hi! protein powder specifically has as much iron and vitamin B12 (if not more) than beef, and provides an alternative rich source of protein to eating meat in general. ""There's evidence supporting other health benefits such as decreasing serum cholesterol and decreasing high blood pressure, but learnings are still preliminary at present,"" he adds. (



Unflavored Protein Powder You Can Add to Anything and Everything

Amazon



Buy It: Hi! Human Improvement Cricket Protein Powder, $12 for 3-pack, amazon.com



Not to mention, unlike traditional livestock, crickets are a more sustainably-minded option. They use 93 percent less land, consume 80 percent less water, and emit nearly 100 percent less greenhouse gas compared to beef, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.On top of the admirable nutritional and ethical elements of crickets themselves, HI! also opted to make sure their single-serve packets are completely recyclable and use 90 percent less packaging than traditional tub-and-scoop protein powders.



The first time I tried this cricket protein powder, I decided to bury it in a rich smoothie, because I really didn't want to feel like I was eating crickets; I combined a packet of the vanilla-flavored blend with peanut butter, almond milk, and a banana. My first sip was creamy and tasted vanilla-y and sweet, just like a milkshake, and the texture of the cricket powder was completely unnoticeable (really, a make or break for me, considering the chalky texture of plant-based proteins is why I'm not a fan of those). And unlike other protein smoothies that I suck down in minutes, this one was so filling that I couldn't finish the whole thing.



I had hoped the cricket protein powder — which doesn't contain GMOs, soy, dairy, gluten, or added sugars — would feel easy on my gut, but I was surprised by just how little it affected my stomach. I felt no bloating, no discomfort, and was full for hours. I tested the chocolate protein powder the next day and was just as pleased with the taste and results. I'm a smoothie gal and haven't tried the buggy powder in plain water or milk yet, so TBD on the taste, but I will say that it tastes damn delicious in my morning blends. (



This Is the Tastiest and Most Satisfying Protein Powder I've Ever Tried — and It's On Sale at Walmart



The powder is admittedly expensive at $4 per single-serve packet, but it's more affordable than my local smoothie shops, and I like supporting sustainably-minded businesses. The protein powder also makes me feel so great that it's worth the splurge, IMO. If you want to try this ethical and gut-friendly protein alternative, you can snag a package of three servings on Amazon for $12 — and then if you decide you love it, you can invest in a 20-count pack for $60. It sounds crazy, but I truly suggest adding edible insects to your life — you won't be sorry.

Artigo 20,"


Between pre-workout powders and post-workout protein chips, electrolyte chews, and creatine pills, it seems a new sports supplement is hitting the market every day. One of the latest options to enter the fold resides in the refrigerator section of many big box gyms and studios: protein water,



But is protein water actually beneficial for your health? Ahead, Reda Elmardi, R.D., C.S.C.S, registered dietician, certified strength and conditioning coach, and founder of wellness site The Gym Goat, breaks down all you need to know about protein water.


   What Is Protein Water, Exactly?  

Protein water is exactly what you think: water infused with protein. And it's lower in fat and calories than your typical protein shake. Sold in the supplement section of many grocery stores or drugstores, protein water includes roughly as much of the macronutrient as other post-workout protein supplements. If you survey the most popular brands, you'll find that one 16-ounce serving of protein water typically contains around 15 to 20 grams of protein and about 100 calories. Obviously, instead of a protein bar or a shake, protein water comes in the form of a fruity liquid.



Recently, many brands have hopped on the protein water bandwagon as the trend has taken off. The brands you're most likely to spot on your local grocery store shelf or in your gym's fridge include Protein2o, Ascent, and Trimino, but Gatorade, Vital Proteins, and Ready. ""While the various protein water options may taste different and have stronger or less strong flavors, they all contain similar ingredients,"" according to Elmardi. The vast majority, for instance, contain whey protein isolate, which is a non-vegan protein extracted from cow milk. (Exceptions would be those that get protein from animal-based collagen peptides, such as Vital Proteins Collagen Water, or a vegan protein, such as pea protein found in My Vegan Protein Water.)


   Are Protein Water Drinks Healthy?  

Ultimately, any food or drink can be incorporated into a healthy diet so long as it's done so in moderation or under the guidance of a healthcare provider. That said, protein waters are generally low in sugar, calories, and sodium, and free of fat and cholesterol, so they may be helpful if you're trying to limit any of the above. (The Ultimate List of High-Protein Foods)



""Despite being sweet in taste, protein water is usually quite low in sugar,"" says Elmardi. The Ascent Orange Mango Recovery Water, for instance, contains just 2 grams of sugar per 17-ounce serving. If you do the math, a similar amount of orange juice can contain nearly 40 grams of sugar. As it goes, protein water has about the same amount of sugar as pre-packaged protein shakes, which are often also quite low in sugar. Though, it's worth noting that both protein water and protein shake products usually contain some artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or stevia, which may be harmful to certain populations (e.g. people who suffer from migraines), according to research.



Protein water is also pretty low in calories. To give you an idea, Protein2o contains 60 calories, Ascent contains 100 calories, and Ready contains 90 calories, each for one 17-ounce serving. That means protein water contains fewer calories than many pre-made protein shakes, making protein water superior for people trying to put on muscle mass and lose weight at the same time, says Elmardi. Protein water can be consumed by those looking to add muscle and mass, but because traditional protein shakes are higher in calories they may be the better option for people having a hard time hitting their caloric goals, he says.


   Benefits of Protein Water  

Thanks in large part to its star macronutrient, protein water offers several perks.


  Supports Post-Workout Recovery  

Protein water's main claim to fame is that it supports post-exercise recovery. Indeed, many of these protein-infused beverages are marketed specifically as recovery drinks. To grasp why this elixir is best after a bout of exercise — especially weighted exercises — you have to understand how muscle growth happens.



When you exercise, you create microscopic tears in your muscles, explains Elmardi. (Sounds counterintuitive, but trust, these tears are ultimately helpful.) After your workout, your body mends those tears by rebuilding muscle fibers. To do this, requires amino acids, which are the building blocks that make up protein, explains Elmardi. To support this muscle repair, it's best to consume a protein-rich snack within two hours of training, according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN). And that's exactly where protein water comes in.



""Protein water contains high levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) which stimulate muscle growth and repair damaged cells,"" explains Elmardi. And so chugging one of these drinks post-workout can support muscle-building goals, he says.



Depending on your specific fitness goals, to really upgrade your post-workout nutrition you may want to nosh on some carbs alongside the protein water, e.g. a banana, rice, or oatmeal. When you exercise, your body uses your stored carbs as its first source of fuel, explains Elmardi. If you fit in a lengthy (we're talking 60-minute) sweat session, you'll need to replenish those carbs with about 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrates, according to the ISSN.



With, on average, just 5 to 10 grams of carbohydrates per bottle, protein water alone doesn't offer enough carbohydrates to meet that recovery criterion. (FTR, that's a similar amount of carbs to what you'll find in most protein shakes, so this is something you'll run into with most pre-made protein drinks).


  Boosts Hydration  

While the macronutrient is obviously the main draw of protein water, it'd be a mistake to ignore that the drink also contains quite a bit of, well, water, which isn't true of all protein supplements. ""The drink is great for hydration,"" says Elmardi. ""Following a workout, drinking protein water can help reduce symptoms of dehydration such as muscle cramps, headaches, or fatigue."" (



How Much Water Do You Actually Need to Drink Per Day?


  Counts Toward Daily Protein Needs  

Just because you sip protein water after you sweat doesn't mean you can't benefit from it on your rest days. The macronutrient isn't just for muscle growth and repair — research shows it can also support healthy digestion, hormone regulation, and skin and tissue health, explains Elmardi.



Exactly how much protein you need per day varies based on your goals and current body weight. ""If you are looking to build muscle mass, then you want to consume around 1 to 1.5 grams per pound of body weight,"" says Elmardi. This helps you recover faster from training sessions and allows you to gain lean muscle mass, he says. If, however, you are trying to lose weight, then you may want to consume 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day, he says. So, a 150-pound athlete would want to consume 150 to 225 grams of protein per day if they were looking to increase muscle mass, or roughly 120 grams of protein each day if they were looking to lose weight.



Regardless, it's possible to meet your recommended protein intake without supplementation through protein water or otherwise and instead with whole foods alone. For a frame of reference, a 3.5-ounce (fist-sized) portion of grilled chicken contains over 30 grams of protein and a 3-ounce slab of salmon contains nearly 20 grams. (See: The Ultimate List of High-Protein Foods)


  Can Aid In Weight Maintenance  

Healthy weight loss may be a side effect of a combo of regular exercise and a post-workout protein water drink. And exercisers who replace their post-workout protein shake with protein water likely will drop some pounds, according to Elmardi. ""If you're trying to lose weight, drinking protein water is a much healthier alternative to consuming protein shakes,"" he says. ""You won't have to worry about gaining extra pounds from the high-calorie content of protein shakes.""



Plus, the macronutrient breakdown of protein water is spelled out on the package. So, if you keep an eye on macro consumption in order to lose (or gain or maintain!) weight, these pre-packaged bottles make it easy to keep a tally.


   Who Should Be Drinking Protein Water?  

For the most part, protein water is marketed for athletes — everyday exercisers and advanced pros alike. So if you work out frequently and have specific fitness goals in mind, protein water may be best for you. To put it simply, ""protein water is best for people who are looking for a quick protein hit after a workout,"" says Elmardi.



Protein water is also especially useful for anyone who has a hard time meeting their daily protein needs, he says. This often includes vegetarians and vegans, who may not get enough protein through their regular diet, he says. Protein water can also be helpful for people who are pregnant or moms who are nursing as well as those who are recovering from surgery or illness, since both groups have higher protein needs, adds Elmardi.



The only people who should avoid protein water are those who are on a lower-protein diet for health reasons, e.g. those with kidney disease or disorders that interfere with protein metabolism. You should also avoid these kinds of products if you try them and get a stomach ache from artificial sweeteners, recommends Elmardi. ""Some people may experience gastrointestinal distress after drinking protein water, so if that occurs, then it's best to avoid drinking protein water altogether,"" he says. But, so long as you tolerate all the ingredients in your protein drink of choice, the odds of this happening are quite low.



At the end of the day, protein water can be a convenient way to make sure you're including enough of the nutrient in your diet. However, if you're not sold on the beverage, you can find protein in a wide range of other supplements or whole foods.

If you've ever dipped a toe into the vast world of workout supplements, you know that there a ton to choose from. And while supplementation is absolutely a useful tool that can help you meet your nutritional, performance, and aesthetic goals (especially if, say, you're prepping for a bodybuilding competition), it's not always super clear which supplements are worth it (and safe) and which ones are a waste of time.



""Supplements aren't regulated by the FDA, meaning there isn't required third-party testing for safety,"" says Amy Goodson, R.D., a board-certified specialist in sports dietetics. That means doing some research on your own ahead of time and/or going directly to a dietitian or doctor for specific brand recommendations is essential. It's especially important to screen the hype now that social media makes trendy bodybuilding supplements, hair growth gummies, ""skinny"" teas, and other magic concoctions seem alluring and legit. Goodson suggests looking for supplements that have been marked as NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Choice. Still, this doesn't mean its intended effects are totally research-backed.



We asked sports nutrition experts for a full rundown on the most popular bodybuilding and workout supplements, what they're supposed to do, and whether or not they're the real deal. Here's what they had to say.


  Protein Powder  

What it's for: Muscle growth



The claim: Probably the most common workout supplement and bodybuilding supplement, protein powder is pretty much everywhere these days. An adequate protein intake helps build, repair, and maintain muscle, according to Ryan Maciel, R.D.N., C.S.C.S.



The evidence: ""There are numerous studies showing the effectiveness and safety of using protein powders,"" Maciel says. Though there are many different kinds, ""whey protein is the most popular because it contains the highest amount of branched-chain amino acids, specifically leucine,"" explains Goodson. ""This is important because research supports leucine as the 'light switch' for turning on muscle resynthesis and thus promotes recovery."" Of course, whey contains dairy, so if you're dairy-free, then soy, pea, egg white, rice, and hemp protein are all good options too.



Recommended dosage: ""The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram body weight for athletes,"" says Maciel. Most people can reach this amount of protein through diet alone, but if you're not quite making it there, protein powder might be a good option. For most women, 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal is a good place to start, according to Maciel. That's equal to about one scoop of the stuff.



And though it's normally recommended that you down a protein shake ASAP after exercise, recent research suggests that hitting your recommended protein intake over the course of the entire day is what matters most. That means you can incorporate protein powder into your day at any time to meet your protein needs for the day and still reap the benefits. (



The Best Protein Powders for Women, According to Nutritionists


  Collagen  

What it's for: Anti-aging, joint health



The claim: ""Collagen is found in our bones, muscles, skin, and tendons,"" Maciel says. ""Collagen is what holds our body together, in a sense. As we age, our collagen production slows and as result, we start to see signs of aging, like wrinkles."" So it makes sense that people think supplementing with collagen could help slow down the effects of aging-and help the body's natural ability to repair joints, muscles, and tendons.



The evidence: While this is one of the most buzzed-about supplements at the moment, you probably don't want to run out and buy it just yet. ""To date, there is no substantial scientific evidence that collagen supplementation can slow or reverse the effects of aging,"" Maciel says. ""You're better off consuming a well-balanced diet made up of lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, being physically active, using sunblock, and not smoking."" Goodson does note that collagen is rich in protein, so if you're looking for an added boost in smoothies, soups, or other foods, a powdered collagen supplement could be a good choice. (



Should You Be Adding Collagen to Your Diet?


  Beta-Alanine  

What it's for: Performance



The claim: ""It can improve exercise capacity and performance during high-intensity exercise,"" Maciel says. ""During high-intensity exercise, hydrogen ions accumulate in your muscles, which can cause muscle fatigue and slow you down. Beta-alanine may help alleviate this by acting as a buffer for those ions.""



The evidence: It's probably legit. ""Beta-alanine may be worth taking if you do high-intensity exercise, since research has shown it can improve performance,"" Maciel says.



Recommended dosage: Somewhere between 2 and 6 grams per day. ""Consume it with a meal for better absorption,"" Maciel recommends. And heads-up: A common side effect is a tingling sensation. ""To reduce this side effect, try taking smaller doses throughout the day or use time-release capsules,"" he adds.


  Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)  

What it's for: Performance and recovery



The claim: ""Branched-chain amino acids are a source of energy in exercise and become a more substantial fuel source in endurance exercise when carbohydrates stores are low,"" Goodson explains. Taking them before and after a workout is supposed to enhance performance and reduce fatigue.



The evidence: ""The evidence doesn't support the marketing claims from supplement manufacturers,"" Maciel says. ""You're better off getting your BCAAs from food sources such as chicken, beef, fish, and eggs. Also, if you drink whey protein, you are getting plenty of BCAAs, so supplementation may be a waste of money."" That said, BCAAs are commonly used as a bodybuilding supplement because they can provide the body with fuel (often for very few calories) during workouts when you're in a calorie deficit. (



Guide to Bodybuilding Nutrition and Meal Prep


  Creatine  

What it's for: Performance and muscle growth



The claim: Creatine is stored in your muscles and supplies them with energy, according to Maciel. ""Creatine supplementation increases your muscles creatine stores, which results in improved performance during intense physical activity, such as sprinting and strength training.""



The evidence: ""Creatine is one of the most researched supplements to date,"" Maciel notes. ""It is proven to be safe and effective for improving strength, power, and lean body mass.""



Recommended dosage: Five grams per day is the most typical dose, Goodson says. While some people may do a ""loading phase"" with a higher dose and then decrease the dosage afterward, this probably isn't necessary. ""Creatine can lead to weight and muscle gain for those who take it consistently, so women looking to lose or maintain weight should take caution,"" she adds. If you're trying to gain muscle for strength, aesthetics, or bodybuilding, however, this can be a useful addition to your routine.


  Pre-Workout Mixes  

What it's for: Performance



The claim: These mixes are formulated to provide more energy for better performance during workouts.



The evidence: ""Pre-workout powders and drinks are all created a little differently based on the brand, but most are a cocktail of carbohydrate, caffeine, some amino acids, creatine, and often beta-alanine, and some contain other vitamins as well,"" says Goodson. ""These are really designed to give people energy from the caffeine and carbohydrate, and possibly provide an added performance booster from creatine.



Recommended dosage: Follow the product directions, with one caveat: ""People who are caffeine-sensitive or who have not eaten anything should always be careful when consuming these types of products,"" says Goodson. (More here: Should You Be Taking Pre-Workout Supplements?)


  Tart Cherry Juice  

What it's for: Recovery



The claim: ""Tart cherry juice or cherry skin powder contains a high concentration of anthocyanins, an antioxidant, that may help you recover quicker and be less prone to illness following strenuous exercise,"" explains Maciel.



The evidence: Studies are limited but promising, Maciel says, but there's not much harm to be done from drinking natural fruit juice, so there's no reason not to try this to speed up recovery.



Recommended dosage: Tart cherries can be consumed in either juice or powder form. The amount that has been studied is 8 to 12 ounces twice a day for four to five days before a strenuous event, and then for two to three days afterward. ""Be aware that tart cherry juice is still juice and does contain a decent amount of carbohydrates, so women looking to lose weight need to factor those calories in if using it as a post-workout or recovery beverage,"" says Goodson.


  Glutamine  

What it's for: Recovery, performance, and muscle growth



The claim: Glutamine is an amino acid that serves as an important fuel source for your body. ""It is believed that supplementation can increase the body's supply of glutamine, which will speed up recovery, increase muscle growth, and improve performance,"" says Maciel. (That's why this is one of the most popular bodybuilding supplements.)



The evidence: There's little scientific evidence to support taking glutamine for improving athletic performance, according to Maciel, so you're probably better off skipping this one.


  Fish Oil  

What it's for: Recovery



The claim: There are a quite a few reasons you might consider taking fish oil (including your heart health), but some athletes swear by the stuff to reduce inflammation and thus, muscle soreness.



The evidence: ""Fish oil gets praise because of its omega-3 fatty acid content,"" says Goodson. ""Omega-3s are essential fatty acids that can contribute to reducing inflammation at the cellular level.""



Recommended dosage: Two to four grams per day is ideal, according to Goodson, although it's a good idea to check with your doctor before starting a higher dose. ""You can also reap the benefits from eating foods like salmon, trout, tuna, soybeans, walnuts, and their oils,"" she notes. (Get more info in this Complete Guide to Omega 3s and 6s.)

Q: Not to get too personal, but I've noticed that after I have my meal replacement shake (which is fortified with more than 100% of some vitamins and minerals), my pee is bright yellow. Should I worry?



A: No, you don't have anything to worry about. The reason your urine turns bright yellow after you have a meal replacement shake that is fortified with high levels of vitamins and minerals is because of the excessive amounts of vitamin B2 that your body does not need. Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is a key component of cellular processes that involve energy production. Your pee turns yellow because the chemical structure of riboflavin get oxidized (a natural and required process). If you have ever taken a B-complex vitamin and noticed that it was orange-yellow in color, that is because of the riboflavin.



You may be concerned about excess riboflavin or other B vitamins, but there is no need for concern, as Bs are water-soluble and your body just gets rid of what it does not need when you go to the bathroom.



One things to consider regarding your fortified meal replacement shakes is can you fuel your body with better nutrition?



The convenience of meal replacement shake packets is hard to beat, but with that convenience you also get antiquated macronutrient ratios and poor quality carbohydrates.



Antiquated Macronutrient Ratios



Just about all meal replacement shakes follow the same formula: about 40 grams of protein, 20 to 25 grams of carbohydrates, 2 to 3 grams of fat, and 0 to 1 gram of fiber. This formula was made extremely popular in the 1990s with EAS's Myoplex shakes, but that was 20 years ago, we can do better. The lack of fat and fiber reduces your meal replacement shake's ability to mimic the satiety effects of an actual meal, and this is further reduced by the fact that liquid calories don't make you full. You also don't need more than 40 grams of protein and could do fine with 30 to 35 grams.



Poor Quality Carbohydrates



The primary carbohydrate source in most meal replacement shakes is maltodextrin. This is good from a food manufacturing standpoint, as maltodextrin is technically not a sugar so the label can read ""low sugar,"" but maltodextrin acts essentially like glucose, causing large and fast increases in your blood sugar levels. This is not the ideal carb source if you are looking for a satiating meal replacement to accelerate weight loss.



If you can get over the convenience factor, then you are better off making your own meal replacement shake. Here is a simple recipe that you can make in a blender in less than five minutes. It will give you adequate protein, quality carbohydrates, fiber, and a blend of different fats, and it won't turn your pee yellow!



1 1/2 scoops vanilla whey protein isolate



1 cup blueberries



2 tablespoons walnuts



1 tablespoons chia seeds



1 to 1 1/2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk or water
