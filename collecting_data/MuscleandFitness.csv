			When it comes to making muscle, it takes two to tango. First we need the stress of exercise to stimulate the need to build muscles and then we need the extra protein to make sure that happens. In other words, you can’t expect to build thick, 3D biceps by neglecting to eat enough of this macro. And since a little extra protein in your diet can help dull hunger you’re less likely to stuff in too many calories when you eat more- one reason why higher protein diets are a boon to fat-loss efforts.
How much is enough? Step on the scale and then shoot for about 1.5 to 1.8 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh (that’s at least 116 grams for a 170-pound guy). This will help you achieve a positive net protein balance where muscle protein breakdown doesn’t outstrip muscle protein synthesis.
Since you can only eat so much food over the course of the day, most fitness-minded guys will default to protein powders for an extra dose of muscle-making aminos. Certainly, a scoop or two of protein powder is an easy and convenient way to help make sure you get what you need. And while smoothies, shakes, or whatever you call them are a natural fit for protein powders of all guises, there are plenty more ways that you can utilize these powders in the kitchen for both flavor and nutritional gain. Whether making a muscle-building oatmeal, mixing up your mom’s fabled cookie recipe or boosting your go-to pancakes, there’s room for an added dose of protein. Why have a shake when you can have a cake?
Below are the tips you need to know to make your favorite protein powder work harder for your muscle-making efforts and the creative and delicious recipes that prove it’s a multi-tasker ingredient. Shaker cup not required.
Tips To Incorporate Extra Protein In Your Daily Life
Here are some ways to give your favorite foods some extra protein love

Stir a scoop or two into a pot of cooked oatmeal.
Blend some powder into dips like hummus.
Add it to yogurt for an even bigger protein push.
Replace some flour with protein powder when making your Sunday pancakes or waffles.
Stir a couple of scoops into a jar of peanut butter or almond butter for a better spread.
Use it to add a protein boost to baked goods like muffins, cookies and brownies.
Incorporate protein powder into homemade energy balls and energy bars.
Try blending into pureed soups.
Unflavored powder can be a good binding agent when making burgers, meatballs and meatloaf.
Consider mixing in a scoop of unflavored protein powder into your mashed potatoes.
Unflavored powder can also be stirred into hot tomato sauce when its pasta night.

Culinary Considerations For Extra Protein Planning
Culinary mastery isn’t required to incorporate extra protein powder in your meals, but it is also not something you should do without any thought. Keep these tips in mind the next time you reach for a tub of powder to beef up the protein of your meals and snacks.

Flavor matters: It is important to match the flavor of your protein powder to the recipe it’s being used in. So a berry-flavored powder could be stirred into yogurt, vanilla would do well in a pancake recipe and plain powder is ideal for savory applications. After all, a caramel-flavored protein powder may not go over too well in a soup recipe.
Hold the whey: When used in baked goods like muffins, whey or casein protein powder tends to result in a rubbery, less tender texture if used too liberally. Generally, you don’t want to replace more than 25% of the flour in a recipe with whey protein powder or you’ll risk eating something that tastes like a tire. For better texture overall, it’s advisable to try using plant-based protein powders for baking purposes as they are not as heat-sensitive as dairy proteins. A good rule of thumb, if you’re looking to modify existing recipes, is to use 1/3 of a cup of a plant-based protein powder like pea for every 1 cup of flour.
Liquid assets: When stirring whey or plant-based powders into batters such as pancakes and cakes you should add a little bit more of a moisturizer such as yogurt, milk, applesauce or pumpkin puree to side-step dry results. Protein powder typically has a substantial drying effect when cooked. Also, don’t over-mix the batter – stir gently just until everything is moist.
Turn down the heat: A slightly lower baking temperature than what is normal – say 325 degrees instead of 350 – will help keep protein powder infused baked goods moister so there is less risk of biting into a hockey puck.
Bury the scoop: Many powders come with a scoop that is convenient when adding the protein to your post-gym shake or something like oatmeal. But for recipes such as muffins and waffles where you want to use a specified amount, it’s best to measure out the powder using measuring cups.
The cover-up: Some powders like pea and hemp can impart earthy flavors to dishes. Using ingredients like cinnamon, mashed banana or cocoa can help mask these tastes.
Trial and error: Finally, not all protein powders behave the same such as dissolving similarly, and the added ingredients in some formulations such as emulsifiers can change how they react in a recipe. So expect that you might have to give a recipe a couple of tries before you figure everything out. And you may have to switch powders to get the results you want.

Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 garlic clove, minced

Here’s your answer to a make-ahead breakfast that will rock your taste buds. Reheat squares in the microwave and served topped with a dollop of Greek yogurt and berries.
Ingredients: Makes 6 Servings

1 cup steel-cut oats
11/2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup protein powder
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
2 teaspoons cinnamon

Pumpkin Pie Protein Ice Cream
Arina P Habich
This easy no-moo “nice cream” has all the frosty sweet creaminess you’d expect in the real stuff but minus the calorie overload. Subzero bananas give you cold, creamy goodness for much fewer calories than dairy cream, while blending in protein powder makes it a treat for your muscles.
Ingredients:: Makes 4 servings

3 frozen chopped bananas
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/3 cup protein powder
1/4 cup almond butter
2 Tbsp pure maple syrup
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger powder

Directions:

Scrape down sides of container and add pumpkin, protein powder, almond butter, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger powder and a pinch of salt. Continue blending just until the point where the mixture is creamy.
Serve your portion immediately and store the rest in an air-tight container in the freezer. For serving leftovers, let ice cream thaw for about 10 minutes to make it easier to scoop out. You can also microwave for 10 seconds at a time to soften slightly.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer covered for 20 minutes.
2. Place soup in a blender container along with protein powder and lime juice and blend until very smooth. Return to pan, stir in cashew or almond milk and heat through.
Lemony Blueberry Chia Pudding

Best Powders To Get That Extra Protein

Gnarly Whey Vanilla: Derived from grass-fed cows, this one mixes well into oatmeal and yogurt and is third-party NSF Certified for Sport so you know you are getting what the label says and nothing else. The addition of prebiotics and probiotics can help make your gut happy.
Dymatize Complete Plant Protein: Containing 25 grams of protein in a serving from five different plant-based protein types including pea and pumpkin seed, this powder is not a whey-free lightweight. And it’s one of the less gritty plant-only options on the market.
ISOPURE Unflavored Zero Carb Protein: True to it’s name, this whey protein isolate powder is free of any flavorings making it a better option for use in savory recipes or where you don’t want the flavor of a powder to come through in the final results.
Bob’s Red Mill Almond Protein Powder: Made from defatted ground almonds, each serving delivers 20 grams of nutty-tasting protein. You also get a bonus of good amounts of fiber, calcium, iron and potassium. One of the better options in baking and pancake recipes.
Vega Nut Butter Shake Peanut Butter: Made with peanut flour, this plant-based powder can instantly make any bowl of yogurt or batch of pancakes taste way more awesome. Flaxseed powder adds a little bit of heart-benefiting omega-3 fat.
My Protein Whey Forward: This one is unique in that it’s made from tiny organisms called microflora, which when fed the same diet as a dairy cow, undergo a fermentation process and remarkably convert plant sugars into milk protein. The end result is a less environmentally costly protein powder that is essentially bioidentical to real whey protein meaning it contains plenty of the amino acid leucine which acts as a primary trigger for muscle growth. Plus, there are fun flavor options like cinnamon cereal.
Timeline Mitopure: Whey protein is beefed up with Urolithin A, a compound that appears to improve how the mitochondria of our cells perform through a crazy process called mitophagy. The outcome might be better muscular strength and endurance.

			For most guys, protein bars seem like a no-brainer: They promise the protein you need to feed your muscles in an ultra-convenient package, while also offering up all sorts of tasty flavors. There are now entire aisles at the grocery store filled with countless options.
With so many of these dang things on the market, it can seem like a Sisyphean task trying to find a bar that tastes good but isn’t masquerading as a candy bar full of questionable ingredients and too little protein do much good. We all shouldn’t be so quick to associate the word “protein” with healthy. And it’s important to look beyond the front-of-label promises and tempting flavors. Let the nutrition facts and ingredient list do the talking.
To help you hunt down the perfect between-meal or post-workout protein-packed option, follow these guidelines when shopping for a bar and consider picking up any of these stand-outs that play by the nutritional rules.

1. Go Bigger on Protein
For a bar that will tame hunger longer and help build your biceps, look for a bar that delivers at least 10 grams of protein (that’s more than an egg!). This can come from animal-based proteins like whey or egg white, or from plants such as pea protein and nuts.
2. Keep Calories in Mind
You may have noticed that calorie counts on bars range widely. For between-meal snacking, stick with bars that have about 250 calories or less. If you’re replacing a meal or eating a bar after a particularly arduous workout, going all the way up to 400 calories can make more sense.
NatalyaBond / M+F Magazine
3. Scan the Sugars
With flavors like fudge brownie and salted caramel, many bars straddle dessert territory. In other words, they can be sugar bombs which can be bad news for your ticker. This 2023 study in the journal BMC Medicine found that it’s not the total amount of carbs in your diet that matters for heart health but the type you eat – total added sugar intake was the strong predictor of heart disease. Ideally, you want to choose a bar with no more than 8 grams of added sugar, with a preference for the sweet stuff coming from natural sources like dried fruits or more benign low-calorie sweeteners such as monk fruit, stevia or erythritol. Luckily, nutrition labels now have to state how much added sugar is included in a bar.
4. I.D. the Fats
For a bar that is going to be easier on your heart, you want one made with healthier unsaturated fats that come from ingredients such nuts, seeds and nut butters instead of a product full of less desirable sources like palm kernel oil or anything hydrogenated.
5. Know your Grains
If a protein bar contains any grains, they should be whole such as oats or quinoa. This will give you a bar with more essential micronutrients and fiber.
Ekaterina_Minaeva / Shutterstock
6. Fight for Fiber
Fiber is important to help keep you feeling full and boost gut health, but not enough guys eat enough. It’s not essential that a protein bar also be high in fiber if your diet is already rich in high-fiber foods like vegetables and legumes, but it can be helpful to find one that has 3 grams or more per serving. With the caveat being if you’re not used to eating a lot of fiber at once, ease into bars that include high amounts of isolated fibers like chicory root or corn fiber to help side-step possible digestive woes like gas and bloating.
7. Less is More
It’s also a good idea to look for a shorter ingredient list to ensure your bar is somewhat less processed. A laundry list of mystery ingredients should be a red flag.

Protein powders for weight loss are a great way to boost your protein intake without cooking mountains of chicken or tofu.

That’s why we’re here to help! Throughout this article, we’ll reveal our top eight protein powders for weight loss, our ranking criteria, the best types of protein, how protein powder supports fat loss, and so much more.

The 8 Best Protein Powders For Weight Loss In 2022
Protein powders are a staple for many. So, you’ll find hundreds and hundreds of different powders on the market. From vegan to casein to the most recommended whey, there are limitless options.
We’ve thoroughly researched the market and tested a bunch of protein products to bring you the eight best options for weight loss!
#1. Huge Whey Protein

Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 130
Protein — 25g
Carbohydrates — 2.5g
Fat — 2g

There’s a reason why Huge Whey Protein sits at the top of the list — it’s our most recommended protein powder for weight loss. Designed for athletes, it packs an applause-worthy 23g of protein into every scoop without overloading on carbs or fat to ensure effective weight loss.
This protein is a great-tasting way to kill your cravings and keep you firmly working toward your weight loss goals. It comes in these six tantalizing flavors:

Fruity Cereal
Blueberry Muffin
Cookie ; Cream
Vanilla Milkshake
Strawberry Cheesecake
Chocolate Peanut Butter

We’re not the only ones who think this whey protein powder is the GOAT — it boasts hundreds of five-star reviews for more-than-satisfied users.
And it won’t break the bank at just $44.95 per tub. Plus, each order of Huge Whey gets a free shaker worth $7.95, which is a nice little extra!
Oh, not to mention you save 10% with Huge Supplements’ “Subscribe ; Save” option. Plus, you can buy it straight from the online store, guaranteeing you receive an authentic and certified product. Try it out for yourself – click here to visit the product page!
#2. Transparent Labs Grass-Fed Whey

Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 120
Protein — 24g
Carbohydrates — 2g
Fat — 0g

Manufactured in the United States of America, Transparent Labs truly care about the quality of its products. The facility producing this whey isolate is certified by the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices for food and dietary supplements.
Like most isolates, the grass-fed whey boasts excellent macros with an oh-so-generous 24g protein per serving, only 1g of carbohydrates, and no fat.
It’s safe to say that these values are wonderful for weight loss. Here’s a few examples of their most popular flavors:

Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie
Milk Chocolate
Cinnamon French Toast
Chocolate Peanut Butter

Whichever one you get, you’re bound to love. Our favorite is the Chocolate Peanut Butter. Chocolate is the dominating flavor, but the peanut butter kicks in near the end for a pleasant aftertaste.
Mixability is great, too, especially with milk. You won’t have to deal with powdery dregs at the bottom of your shaker or chunky drinks.
Despite all this goodness, there’s one massive downside — it’s ridiculously expensive. You’ll pay $59.99 for a 2.2lb tub. If you plan to use protein powder on a daily/twice daily basis, you’ll clean your wallet out pretty quickly with this one.
#3. Huge Vegan Protein

MD Media

CLICK HERE TO SHOP
Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 110
Protein — 20g
Carbohydrates — 3.5g
Fat — 1.5g

If you want to experience all the benefits of our top-rated protein powder, Huge Whey Protein, but you subscribe to veganism, then Huge Vegan Protein is undoubtedly your best option.
This 100% plant-based, non-GMO, dairy-free, and gluten-free powder contains the complete amino acid profile, which typically isn’t found in vegan proteins. Huge Supplements has achieved this by crafting it from a mixture of peas, brown rice, mung beans, and fava beans and simplifying the ingredients list to the essentials.
Its macros reign supreme for weight loss too! Since you’re on a weight loss journey, feeling full without wolfing down the calories is essential — and this vegan protein powder will help you do that with only 110 calories per scoop and a respectable 20g of protein.
As for the taste, this will largely depend on the flavor you pick. The vegan protein powder comes in a wide range of unique flavors, so you’re bound to find one that tickles your tastebuds.
The flavor choices (and how they truly taste) are as follows:

Birthday Cake — as expected, standard birthday cake flavor with sprinkles
Graham Cracker — one of the more unassuming flavors, great for adding to smoothies for a big protein hit
Marshmallow Madness — for those with a sweet tooth
Cookies ; Cream — consider this your liquid (macro-fitting) Oreo
Cinnamon Crunch — somewhat spicy taste like a cinnamon cereal mix

It’s quite rare to find a vegan protein powder with such a range of exotic flavors. We’d take advantage of it if we were you!
Price is another area in which Huge Supplements Vegan Protein shines. At a mere $40 per tub, it’s a good price, especially with the world’s seemingly ever-rising costs.
#4. Ghost Whey

Courtesy of MD Media.

CLICK HERE TO SHOP
Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 130
Protein — 25g
Carbohydrates — 4g
Fat — 1.5g

As far as packaging goes, Ghost Whey certainly stands out from the crowd. However, the brand is primarily focused on pre-workouts.
Despite that, it delivers a good amount of protein per scoop, and it digests effectively. Not to mention it’s one of the few protein powders that taste great with water.
Specifically, one scoop of Ghost Whey contains 14.53g of isolate, 2.98g of hydrolyzed isolate, and 13.16g of concentrate. The company sunflower lecithinated the isolate and concentrate to ensure smooth mixability without the addition of soy.
On top of the macros, it contains 10% of your daily calcium intake and 6% of your daily iron.
#5. Bare Performance Nutrition Whey

MD MEDIA

CLICK HERE TO SHOP
Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 130
Protein — 25g
Carbohydrates — 3g
Fat — 2g

Like any protein powder worth your money, the main ingredient found in BPN Nutrition Whey is whey (a fast-absorbing protein). However, you’ll also find sucralose, casein (a slow-digesting protein), acesulfame potassium, and salt inside.
The company has introduced a well-rounded selection of nine flavors, as per the following:

Milk N’ Cookies
Cinnamon Roll
Chocolate Peanut Butter
Blueberry Muffin
Fruity Cereal
Fudge Chocolate
Vanilla
Nutter Bar Blast
Apple Pie

The powder has undergone Informed Protein tests to confirm the protein levels stated on the label are accurate. Plus, every batch is tested for prohibited substances since BPN is Informed Sport Certified.
#6. Dymatize Elite Whey

Huge Supplements

CLICK HERE TO SHOP
Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 140
Protein — 25g
Carbohydrates — 2g
Fat — 3g

The Dymatize Elite Whey protein powder has above-average buyer ratings, and you receive a decent amount of BCAAs and protein per scoop. The whey-blend product comes in an appreciated 12 different flavors, including Cocoa Pebbles, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Vanilla, Chocolate, and Cookies ; Cream.
We love the fact that it’s sweetened artificially, so you don’t have to deal with added sugar, ensuring it’s perfect for weight loss.
Several of the ingredients are lab-produced. Therefore, it isn’t the purest protein powder available. But, of course, the ingredient list changes slightly depending on the flavor you purchase.
The cost per serving is phenomenal. However, the protein percentage per weighted serving isn’t the best.
 
#7. MusclePharm Combat Whey

MD MEDIA

CLICK HERE TO SHOP
Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 140
Protein — 25g
Carbohydrates — 6g
Fat — 1.5g

MusclePharm has built a reputation based on its protein bar, Combat Crunch, a staple for plenty of MMA fighters. However, the Colorado-based company’s whey powder is great too.
It’s a blend of whey concentrate and whey isolate, with a bunch of other ingredients
Typically, protein powders don’t contain as many gums since they’re thickeners and stabilizers. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s certainly unusual. However, we don’t particularly like the lack of digestive enzymes — manufacturers usually add them to whey concentrate products to make them gut-friendly.
Despite that, it’s very cheap ($26 for a 2lbs) and comes in three flavors — Chocolate Milk, Chocolate, and Cookies ; Cream.
#8. MuscleTech Nitro-Tech Whey

Courtesy of MD MEDIA

CLICK HERE TO SHOP
Nutrients Per Scoop:

Calories — 160
Protein — 30g
Carbohydrates — 4g
Fat — 3g

MuscleTech Nitro-Tech Whey is incredibly high in protein, with a whopping 30g per scoop. However, it’s one of the most calorific on our list, so may not be the best option if you are strictly controlling your calorie intake.
That said, it contains L-carnitine, which is much-loved by athletes due to its muscle-fatigue-prevention abilities. The amino acid derivative also plays a major role in boosting your metabolism, helping you along your weight loss journey.
The primary downside? It only comes in three flavors — chocolate fudge brownie, French vanilla swirl, and French vanilla bean. And for the price (around $39.99 for 2lbs), we think they should make more flavors available.
How We Ranked the Best Protein Powders for Weight Loss
How did we put together our list of the best protein powders for weight loss? Well, we reviewed them based on the following criteria:
Protein Type
The most effective protein type is whey, derived from cow’s milk. Therefore, we usually only recommend this kind. Although, Huge Vegan Protein is great for those on plant-based diets.
Taste and Flavor Options
Variety is the spice of life, so protein powders available in a wide range of flavors get a huge thumbs up from us.
Of course, the flavors must taste good and mix well too. Otherwise, it defeats the purpose! Plus, you’re more likely to continue using it if it satisfies your palate.
Ratings
Protein powders without lots of positive reviews are frightening. The products we recommend have tons of five-star ratings from super happy customers to ensure we aren’t the only gym-goers who love them.
Steer clear of those with more negative the positive reviews. They aren’t worth your hard-earned cash.
Prices
Nobody wants to overpay for things, and neither do we. So, price played a major role in the products we recommend.
All the protein powders in our top eight list are high-quality and priced reasonably, with Transparent Labs Grass-Fed Whey being the only truly expensive option.
The Different Types of Protein Powders for Weight Loss
As we’re sure you’ve already noticed, there are loads of different types of protein powders for weight loss available. So, we’ll run through four of the most prominent options here, helping you make a well-informed choice.
Whey Protein
Provided you aren’t vegan, whey protein is the type we recommend. Derived from cow’s milk, it’s the most popular type of protein for a very good reason — it’s the highest-quality protein source, thanks to its amino acid content and near-effortless absorption.
On top of that, it’s a “complete” protein. In other words, it contains all nine essential amino acids your body needs for optimal functioning. Not to mention it has a high PDCAAS score, which is a rating system measuring the digestibility and utilization of a protein-packed product.
However, there are a few subtypes of whey protein to choose from:

Whey concentrate — Generally speaking, this is the lowest-quality whey protein as it doesn’t go through as much refinement. It contains 80% pure protein by weight, but some powders run lower. The remaining is comprised of fat and carbohydrates.
Whey isolate — Isolates have a minimum of 90% protein by weight, thanks to their extensive refinement and concentration process. It’s the go-to protein source for professional athletes, but it is more expensive.
Whey hydrolysate — The final type has been treated with enzymes, acids, or heat for even speedier absorption. However, it’s the most expensive option and is harder to find.

Casein Protein
Casein, primarily used for making cheese, is the other kind of protein found in cow’s milk.
Like whey, it harbors all nine essential amino acids. But unlike whey, casein protein has slow digestive properties because it curdles once it hits your stomach acid, decelerating the process.
Bodybuilders tend to take casein before they go to bed to ensure they receive a slow release of amino acids during the night when they would otherwise experience fasting.
Casein contains a higher portion of histidine, phenylalanine, and methionine, the amino acids not known for jumpstarting the muscle-building process. As such, it’s regarded as less effective than whey protein, which has a higher leucine, valine, and isoleucine content.
That said, casein protein powders boast a range of bioactive peptides that benefit your digestive and immune systems. Some studies show they also lower your blood pressure and reduce the likelihood of blood clots, keeping your heart healthy.
The peptides work like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are a class of medication prescribed to maintain optimal blood pressure.
Vegan Protein
Vegan protein is a savior for those on plant-based diets — even though they are generally considered lower quality than animal-based powders due to their “incomplete” nature (i.e., they’re missing some of the essential amino acids). Plus, vegan protein products tend to come with lower PDCAAS scores, indicating poorer digestibility.
But, they’re a fantastic option if you have a dairy intolerance or choose not to eat animal products.
Like whey protein, there are a few types to choose from:

Pea protein — Made from yellow split peas, it’s one of the only plant-based powders deemed complete. However, it has a high iron content which reduces absorption. That said, you can offset this by eating vitamin C-rich foods like citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables, and tomatoes.
Hemp protein — It’s a highly versatile vegan protein derived from hemp seed. You can easily blend it into smoothies or sprinkle it on oatmeal.
Brown rice protein — This option is an incomplete protein powder because it’s low in lysine. Research showed it may be as effective as whey protein for increasing strength and decreasing fat.
Soy protein — Like pea protein, soy protein is a complete powder that also contains fiber, calcium, zinc, iron, and vitamin B.

Egg Protein
Egg protein doesn’t circulate the mainstream market much and tends to be more expensive than whey powders. Although, it works well if you’re allergic or intolerant to lactose.
Since it’s made from egg whites only, it’s protein-rich with zero fat, making it great for weight loss. It also boasts a decent amount of micronutrients.
When trying to lose weight, satiety (i.e., feeling full) is a huge obstacle for most people. According to a study that directly compared whey protein to egg protein, the latter is less effective at helping you feel full for more extended periods.
That said, egg protein powder is the second-highest source of leucine after whey! Therefore, it’s fantastic for muscle building and recovering from workouts if you can’t consume lactose.
How Protein Powder Supports Weight Loss
We don’t doubt that you’ve seen plenty of all-muscle men and women chugging protein shakes on social media. However, they are just useful for muscle building; they’re also great for weight loss.
Plenty of studies have looked into the effectiveness of protein powder for weight loss, and the evidence gives it a huge thumbs up. So, let’s take a look at a few of the benefits you can expect from incorporating protein shakes into your diet:
Decreases Appetite and Cravings
As anyone on an eating plan for weight loss will know, feeling hungry is no fun — hangry is a term for a reason!
But luckily, protein has been shown to keep you satiated for longer without overly increasing your calorie intake, making it easier to stick to your lifestyle change and shift the fat.
One of the main reasons behind protein’s excellent ability to keep cravings and appetite at bay is it triggers the release of “fullness” hormones known as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and PYY.
A plethora of studies also determines that eating more protein can result in fewer feelings of hunger during the day.
In one such experiment, older women who ate a protein-packed breakfast consumed 135 calories fewer later on compared to those who skipped breakfast or ate a low-protein morning meal.
A meta-analysis of five studies also concluded that increasing protein also increased fullness. Although, Bruce A. Craig, Ph.D., and the reports’ other authors noted the importance of eating behavior, body weight, and other health factors in satiation.
By now, you might be wondering whether any similar studies have been conducted on protein shakes specifically. And to that, we say yes, but only a few.
One study on nine young women with obesity showed that whey protein shakes actively reduced appetite, while another study concluded that consuming a high-protein drink before exercising reduced hunger afterward.
Supports Lean Muscle Growth and Metabolism
Increasing your protein intake can help you build muscle, especially when you add strength training to your weight loss regime. Muscle aids metabolism and energy. Therefore, building muscle is perfect for maintaining a healthy metabolism.
If you’re currently in a calorie deficit (i.e., you’re burning more calories than you’re consuming) to lose weight, you might experience muscle loss as well as fat loss. Losing lean muscle could decelerate your metabolism, meaning you could gain the weight back again once you finish your restrictive eating plan.
Thankfully, you can negate this worry by eating enough protein and weight training to prevent muscle loss and speed up muscle recovery.
A study conducted by Robert R Wolfe and Peter J M Weijs on older adults with obesity found people who drank an additional 20g of protein per week gained 2.8lbs more muscle than those who ate less.
In a different six-week study, people followed a high- or low-protein calorie-restricted diet. Like the Wolfe and Weijs study, the results showed that those on the higher protein plan acquired 2.4lbs more muscle and lost 2.9lbs more fat.
Notably, your body expends more energy when digesting protein than it does for other macronutrients. Therefore, you burn more calories just by upping your protein. This phenomenon is known as the thermic effect of protein and provides a small (but mighty) metabolic boost.

Helps with Losing Fat
Unfortunately, not many studies focus on the use of protein shakes specifically when testing protein’s helpfulness in losing fat. However, researchers tend to agree that a high-protein diet is effective for weight loss and body fat reduction.
For instance, one 14-week study gave women with obesity a high-carb or high-protein calorie-restricted diet to follow alongside a resistance-based exercise program.
The outcome? The women in the high protein group lost 1.7 times more fat than the others!
Another 12-week study gave women with healthy body weights but high fat percentages a high- or standard-protein diet. Those in the former group lost an extra 3lbs of body fat and 1 inch in waist measurement. Not to mention they retained considerably more muscle than those on the regular-protein diet.
Of course, a plethora of lifestyle and ingredient factors come into play when losing fat. What works for some people may not work for you (unfortunately). However, the general consensus from experts and those on their own fitness journeys is that increasing protein intake will improve weight/fat loss.
Supports Weight Management
You want your weight loss efforts to last, right? Well, protein’s effect on appetite, metabolism, and muscle mass can keep you from regaining fat once you’ve lost it!
A review published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that ingesting 25g to 30g of protein per meal improves both weight loss and weight management. Naturally, other lifestyle factors contribute to the effectiveness of this plan.
Do You Really Need Protein Powder to Lose Weight?
After all that, no, you do not need protein powder to lose weight — but it will certainly help you out!
Not only does it boost your protein intake to reduce cravings, but it’s directly linked to fat loss and increased muscle growth, making your weight loss journey easier. Plus, it can help you keep the fat off once you’ve lost it for a lifetime of feeling great.
And if you needed another reason to hop on the protein powder train — the shakes taste great. Once you’ve found a flavor you love, drinking a shake will start feeling like a treat, which will further prevent pesky cravings from ruining your progress or mental health.
For the best results, you can combine protein shakes with other sources of protein throughout the day, such as:

Nuts and seeds — Seeds and nuts contain roughly 5g to 7g of protein per ounce, depending on the type you eat. Combine it with hemp or soy milk for a complete plant-based protein source.
Animal-based foods — Poultry, meat, eggs, dairy, and fish are great sources of complete protein. If you can eat animal-based products, you’ll gain the most benefits from eating protein from these sources, as plant-based foods often lack at least one essential amino acid.
Greek or plant-based yogurt — They typically give you 6g to 10g of protein per 3.5 ounces.
Spirulina — The blue algae provides 4g of complete protein per tablespoon. A two-tablespoon serving includes 95% of your Daily Value for copper and 22% of your Daily Value for iron.
Puffed quinoa — A 2.5-ounce serving of puffed quinoa provides 10g of complete protein. You can even add it to shakes for a thicker texture and a hint of nuttiness.
Tofu — Tofu is popular among vegans and vegetarians thanks to its protein-rich characteristic. You’ll obtain from 5g to 13g of protein per 3.5 ounces.
Oats — You get around 5g of protein per 1.5 ounces. Use hemp milk or oat milk for a complete protein meal.

How to Use Protein Powder for Weight Loss
The right timing for drinking protein shakes is an ongoing debate in the fitness community. But frankly, it depends on your day-to-day routine and goals.
Since you’re trying to lose weight, we recommend drinking a protein shake in the morning when your body craves fuel. A protein-filled breakfast will speed up your metabolism and ensure you feel full without adding a whole bunch of calories right off the bat.
Additionally, you should consider drinking a protein shake after your workouts to help your muscles recover and replace the protein you burned off through exercise.
The Perfect Powder-to-Liquid Ratio
No matter which of our best protein powders for weight loss you buy, the packaging will tell you the serving size and how to make your shake.
But for your convenience, here’s a simple guide:

Pour one or two scoops (the scoop will be in the container with the powder) of protein powder into your shaker.
Add at least 200ml of water or milk. The more liquid you add, the thinner your shake will be. For weight loss, we recommend sticking to water if you’re really trying to keep your calories down. However, you can use skim milk if you don’t like the taste.
Put the lid on properly (sounds obvious, but we’ve all watched in horror as powder and milk fly across the kitchen due to an unsecured cap!) and shake thoroughly for 30 seconds.
Enjoy your protein shake!

CLICK TO SHOP GOLD STANDARD WHEY
GNC has long been a company famous for making good protein and supplement products, and though it doesn’t quite beat Huge Whey as our top pick, their Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder is no exception.
Though it is more expensive than Huge Whey, it offers comparable levels of protein and branched chain amino acid content for muscle and weight gain during workouts. This product’s main claim to fame is, indeed, the Whey Protein Isolates that are celebrated as the purest form of whey protein for ideal health benefits.
In addition to containing all of these health-boosting ingredients, Gold Standards does not sacrifice taste. This is a factor that cannot be overlooked when hoping to increase weight gain!
While benefiting from 24 grams of protein, you can enjoy flavors like Strawberry Banana, Chocolate Malt, Double Rich Chocolate, Cookies ; Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream, Extreme Milk Chocolate, Strawberries and Cream, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Chocolate Hazelnut, and French Vanilla Cream.

4.   Ghost Whey

CLICK TO SHOP GHOST WHEY
It is likely that their gripping product artwork has caught your eye, but the weight-gain benefits of Ghost Lifestyle’s Ghost Whey Protein powder are just as attention-grabbing! Combining natural digestive enzymes with a protein blend that harnesses the power of 100% whey isolates, Ghost Whey is another excellent product.
With 4 grams of total carbs, more than 25 grams of protein, and the added benefit of excluding soy and gluten, it’s no wonder that Ghost Whey is popular with customers. It also contains a few nice flavor options.
These taste varieties include Coffee Ice Cream, Fruity Cereal Milk, Peanut Butter Cereal Milk, Cinnamon Cereal Milk, Marshmallow Cereal Milk, and Milk Chocolate, as well as plain Cereal Milk.
Though it is a little pricier than our favorite Huge Whey protein at around $45, Ghost Whey is still a standout among the protein powder options on the supplement market of 2022.
5.   NutraBio Classic Whey

Courtesy of MD Media.

CLICK TO SHOP CLASSIC WHEY
Next up on the list of protein powders we researched and found a cut above the rest is Vitacost’s NutrBio Classic Whey Protein powder! This option is not only chock full of great weight-gain benefits, but it is tasty and easily mixed into cereals or protein shakes or even yogurt for quick intake.
NutraBio’s product has been beloved for its quality ingredients since the year 1996, and celebrated for the lack of GMOS, TSEs and BSEs in every blend. Without spiking the protein, adding any inferior sources of protein, or treating their Whey with acids, this blend still offers great weight gain through high-quality ingredients.
Not only that, but the taste is, once again, very well supported in this choice. Though it does not offer as many or as creative in terms of flavor varieties, NutraBio still has a few classic options for customers. One is Chocolate Milkshake, along with Creamy Vanilla and Chocolate Peanut Butter Bliss.
It is worth mentioning that NutraBio’s Classic Whey blend is expensive, though the value is high, at around $75. Although it does not quite make the top of our best protein powders for weight gain list, NutraBio’s Classic Whey protein is still an acceptable choice for muscle pumps and overall health.
6.   Rule One Proteins

CLICK TO SHOP RULE ONE PROTEINS
Marketed as the overachiever of protein powders is our next option, Rule 1 Whey Blend protein! This option offers 24 grams of the protein needed to build muscle mass, gain weight, and improve health in every serving.
Added to this benefit is the complete lack of creamers or sugars. Instead, you get 5 grams of branched chain amino acids and 4 grams of glutamine for the aid of overall health. This three-way formula is celebrated by customers not just for great ingredients, but for a variety of flavors that are easily incorporated into tasty shakes and yogurt mixtures alike.
Some of these flavors are only available depending on the serving size a customer chooses to order, making it less simple to choose a favorite than it would be for our top pick, Huge Whey.
For example, the 28-serving, the ideal available form of the product, offers all flavor options, including Toasted Cinnamon Cereal, Cookies ; Cream, Lightly Salted Caramel, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Fudge, and Strawberries and Cream.
However, if the smallest size is ordered, you’ll only get Chocolate Fudge and Vanilla Ice Cream, with the addition of two flavors unique to the size: Rainbow Sherbet and Birthday Cake. On the other hand, the largest size, serving 136, only offers the Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Fudge flavors.
Even with these many buying options, which make decision making a little trickier, we found this product to deserve it’s place on our best protein powders list for weight gain benefits!

Rival Nutrition’s Clean Gainer is deserving of its place on our weight gain list of protein powders, and not just for its name! Though it is more expensive than a few of our other options at $50, Rivalus Clean Gainer packs around 30 grams of protein per serving.

Thanks to being low in sugar content and tasting fantastic, in addition to a fair price for what you’re getting, Pure Protein Whey is very deserving of its place rounding out our best protein powder for weight gain list!
How We Choose the Best Protein Powders For Weight Gain
When it comes to picking out the best product, we do not simply search according to our own personal preferences.
Finding a product that is not only enjoyable to use, but fairly priced and, above all, is actually effective in helping with weight gain, is our goal.
We accomplish this goal by looking for the following qualities!
Protein and Calories
All of the human body is made up of proteins, from our fingernails to our vital organs! In addition, calories are one of the main players in increasing weight gain if that is your goal.
Therefore, both protein and calorie content could not be overlooked when we hunted for the very best of the best protein powders on the 2022 market.
Product Quality
The best quality products are not just the ones with the coolest packaging or highest keyword count. Quality is determined by effectiveness, which is, in turn, determined by a mixture of well-sourced ingredients and scientifically backed products.
For example, the ratio of calories to protein, like the one found in Huge Whey, was something we very seriously considered for each product. The ideal protein powder for weight gain is sweetened sparingly and places emphasis on protein content, the same way Huge Whey does.
Taste and Flavor Choices
Although healthy, high-quality ingredients and finely honed mixtures of those ingredients are very important, nobody likes to make something that tastes bland or gross a part of their daily routine.
Therefore, we studied each of our protein powders to see which ones combined great taste with the best variety of choices.
Most protein powders stick with the basic vanilla and chocolate mixtures, but the best branch out into cereal-like flavors. In the case of our favorite product, Huge Whey, a large amount of flavors to choose from was offered, and none of them disappointed!
Budget
Finally, we always made sure that the products we choose are priced fairly according to the benefits and effectiveness each one offers. A good protein powder is worth paying for, as long as the ingredients are correctly balanced, sourced, and effective for what they claim!
We found the products on our Top 9 List above to be priced fairly according to their worth, with Huge Whey being the highest quality bang for your buck!
How Protein Powder Helps You Gain Weight
In general, protein powders are marketed as healthy supplements and are associated with a lifestyle of working out and staying active. For these reasons, it is perfectly natural to wonder how protein powder helps you gain weight, when it seems specifically created for leanness in the human body.
Actually, human beings gain weight not just in fat, but in muscle mass, too. If you are trying to bulk up, your body needs a high amount of carbohydrates, calories, and, of course, protein. All of these are ingredients amply provided in common protein powders.
However, it is the way that you combine these protein powders with activity that ultimately determines weight gain.
A calorie surplus is needed to gain weight through muscle mass. This simply means that the body needs to be consuming more calories than the ones that are being burned each day.
For example, if you are burning around 500 calories during each intense workout, you will need to eat significantly more for your body to transform those calories into muscle mass.
Eating junk food like processed fast foods or ice cream can contribute to your calorie count, but it does so by also giving you plenty of harmful ingredients at the same time. Instead of making your body sort the good from the bad as you prepare for a workout, use protein powders to get straight to the good stuff!
Protein powders should be combined with strength training exercises and resistance training exercises. This training actually synthesizes muscle protein synthesis. This muscle protein synthesis is what your body engages in to create muscle mass.
Protein powder can cause amino acids to be more easily absorbed by the human body when placed in a good protein shake and ingested before a workout. This amino acid content in the bloodstream bumps up the muscle protein synthesis, making muscles larger and more energized during a workout.
This is not only helpful for promoting a bigger gain of muscle mass in the body, but improving the speed at which these muscles recover after a workout so that you don’t have to spend quite as much time in cooldown while the healing process is underway. That means they’re also considered a muscle recovery supplement.
Essentially, a good protein powder enhances a workout and makes everything your body is doing to create more weight through muscle mass work more quickly and smoothly.
How to Make a Protein Shake For Gaining Weight
As previously touched upon in this article, the main thing to remember when trying to use a protein powder for weight gain is making sure you create a large caloric intake.
However, you don’t want to sacrifice taste or texture, and if you’re a beginner, we hope you’ll benefit from this step-by-step guide to making a protein shake for gaining weight!

Add Your Protein Powder – We recommend using one to two scoops of whey protein powder, and we cannot recommend Huge Whey protein enough!
Add in Oats – Generally, oats are full of health benefits. For gaining muscle mass, however, they have additional proteins and around 66% of a raw oat is pure protein. They taste great, too, especially if you like your protein shake with more depth of flavor than sweetness.
Add in Fruit – Speaking of sweetness, fruit is some of the best that nature has to offer in terms of flavor and benefits to our health. We definitely recommend putting a single banana in your protein shakes for the greatest source of potassium and gains to your overall muscle mass, but berries and even an avocado are great, too.
Add in Nuts – In addition to oats, nuts are another great source of fiber and muscle-building protein to boost the effects of your protein powder to the next level.
Add in Peanut Butter – A single tablespoon of peanut butter contains four whole grams of protein. So while you’re already bumping up your protein intake through Huge Whey, you’re only getting that much more with peanut butter, in addition to a great taste and antioxidants.
Blend or Shake – Throw all of the above into a blender if you decide to use half a cup of ice for texture, or use the free shaker that comes with Huge Supplements’ Whey product. Either way, the goal is to mix thoroughly.
Enjoy – With your carefully-mixed ingredients and great choice of protein powder, you should have a protein shake that is chock-full of health benefits, not to mention enough protein content to boost weight gain.

Other Protein Powder Recipes For Weight Gain
Using protein powder in a shake is not the only recipe you are limited to, especially if you want to gain weight! Using a great protein powder like Huge Whey, which comes in a variety of flavors, your options are actually closer to limitless.
For example, consider baking your protein powder into brownies, muffins, or other baked goods as a way to supplement the other dry ingredients in the usual mixture. This will add to the weight-gain benefits and, of course, taste great too.
Another fantastic method of using protein powder to gain weight mass is to include it in your oatmeal or yogurt for breakfast or snacks. By adding this simple step to your daily food intake, you can reach your weight gain goals even more quickly and creatively.
Should You Use Protein Powder to Gain Weight?
Yes, we highly recommend using protein powder to gain weight. It makes hitting your protein goals a lot easier, thus helping you pack weight on quicker.
Although keep in mind, it is not a must. Protein powder and protein shakes should not replace a healthy diet. But if you can afford it, go for it!
Final Thoughts: Best Protein Powders For Weight Gain
To sum it all up, the best way to gain weight is through a targeted intake of calories, carbohydrates, and proteins. Although almost all protein powders contain these elements, only a select few do so through optimal blends, well-sourced ingredients, and great flavors without compromising on fair pricing.
Our Top 9 Best Protein Powders For Weight Gain includes the prime examples of these few products on the 2022 market, with Huge Whey Protein taking the top spot for unbeatable benefits and flavor variety.
Using Huge Whey in a protein shake, especially one that is jam packed with beneficial ingredients like nuts and fruits and peanut butter, gaining weight should be no problem at all.
Be sure to purchase Huge Whey in all of it’s muscle-pumping glory either on the Huge Supplements website or Amazon.com for the best results in your weight-gain journey!

Researchers have understood that creatine can boost athletic performance since the 20th century. However, it wasn’t until after the Barcelona Summer Olympics in 1992 that the supplement went mainstream.
Creatine is naturally produced by your body, offering energy to your muscles and other tissue.
But supplementing it can increase your muscular creatine content by a whopping 40%, promoting muscle gain, improving performance, and enhancing strength.
The best part? It’s one of the most researched supplements out there, which proves it’s fantastic at packing on the lean mass you’re working hard for.
Due to extensive research, it also boasts an outstanding safety record, making it ultra-popular in the fitness community.
However, there are a few different types of creatine to be aware of — monohydrate, ethyl ester, hydrochloride, buffered, liquid, and magnesium chelate.
We’ve specifically suggested creatine monohydrate because it’s the most cost-effective and heavily studied.
In fact, the most recent review published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition declared that monohydrate has more of a physiological impact than other types of supplemental creatine.
So, if you’re looking for a supplement to get gains fast, we recommend starting with creatine monohydrate. There’s a reason it’s number one on our list!
How to Use Creatine Monohydrate
You should take between 3g and 5g of creatine monohydrate every day, whether it’s a training day or not.
Since the supplement accumulates in your muscles naturally, you don’t have to worry about the time you take it or what you take it with.
#2. Whey Protein Powder

Sponsored and By MD Media.

SHOP WHEY PROTEIN POWDER
There are lots of protein powders on the market, but they weren’t all created equally — whey is the best of the best.
Whey protein is a mix of isolated proteins from (you guessed it) whey (i.e., the liquid portion of milk that separates when making cheese).
Historically, cheesemakers would throw the whey out. But, in recent times, they realized the commercial value, sending it to supplement manufacturers to be turned into the whey protein that many bodybuilders and gymgoers know and love — a powder for shakes, meal replacements, or protein bars.
Supplementing with protein powder is a highly convenient way to add protein (i.e., your muscles’ building blocks) to your diet, resulting in increased muscle mass.
Not only does it contain all nine fast-absorbing essential amino acids, but it also boasts a pretty high branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) content, including leucine and cysteine.
As research shows, leucine is the most growth-promoting amino acid. Cysteine increases levels of glutathione in the body, a cellular antioxidant.
You have three types of whey protein powder to choose from:

Concentrate — Contains between 70% and 80% protein with lactose and fat. We think it’s the best-tasting type.
Hydrolysate — Otherwise known as hydrolyzed whey, it’s pre-digested for faster absorption. Although, it’s known to spike insulin levels more than isolate powders.
Isolate — Contains at least 90% protein with less fat and lactose. However, it lacks many of the nutrients found in concentrated whey powders.

Overall, we suggest choosing whey protein concentrate because it’s the cheapest, contains the most beneficial nutrients, and has a better flavor.
How to Use Whey Protein Powder
You should take one to two scoops (roughly 25g to 50g) of whey protein powder per day, typically after workouts. However, always check the packaging for proper serving guides.
#3. Amino Acids

Sponsored and By MD Media.

SHOP AMINO ACIDS
Amino acids are the building blocks of muscle tissue and protein. Therefore, they play a massive role in many of your body’s processes associated with energy, mood, recovery, cognitive function, strength, fat loss, and muscle gains.
There are 20 amino acids in total. Nine of these are classified as essential (i.e., they must come from your food intake), and 11 of them are non-essential (i.e., your body synthesizes them from the essential amino acids).
Most people get amino acids from foods such as lean meats, protein shakes, and non-fat dairy products. However, fitness fanatics often take amino acid supplements separately to enhance performance and build muscle more effectively.
The common type of amino acid supplement is BCAAs (or branched-chain amino acids). There are three BCAAs — leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which prevent muscle breakdown during training and ensure you gain as much size as possible.
On top of that, they help optimize body composition by assisting with fat loss. So, even when you’re in a calorie deficit, you can retain muscle mass!
How to Use Amino Acids
Always follow the manufacturer’s directions when it comes to dosing BCAAs. Usually, one scoop will be between 15g and 20g.
We recommend taking amino acids during or after your workouts for maximum absorption and effectiveness.
#4. Turkesterone

Sponsored and By MD Media.

SHOP TURKESTERONE
Taking turkesterone supplements has somewhat recently gained a lot of popularity among bodybuilders who adore it for its accelerated muscle-growing effects.
Turkesterone is a type of ecdysteroid, a hormone found in plants. It’s derived from the Ajuga turkestanica plant found in central Asia and is known to enhance strength, increase muscle gain, decrease fatigue, and quicken recovery times.
Ecdysteroids are often compared to testosterone due to their growth-inducing abilities. However, they don’t connect to androgen receptors, ensuring you don’t suffer any negative steroidal side effects, like hair loss.
So, how does it improve muscle growth?
Well, it enhances MPS or muscle protein synthesis. Turkesterone does this by perfecting the mRNA translation process and boosting the muscle cells’ intake of leucine.
In turn, the muscles experience a positive nitrogen balance, preventing breakdown and allowing you to more easily keep the gains you’ve earned.
Evidence suggests that the supplement significantly enhances strength and mass in humans. In fact, research shows that it’s just as effective (if not more so) as results from androgenic steroids and doesn’t require post-cycle therapy afterward.
Some fitness fanatics consider it the safe version of steroids. As research concludes, there aren’t any side effects to taking turkesterone — it even boasts brain-protecting properties.
How to Use Turkesterone
We recommend running an eight-to-12-week cycle of turkesterone, taking 500mg every day with the first meal of the day for the entire duration. Although, beginners may want to start with 250mg and work up from there.
Note: Turkesterone may induce nausea if taken on an empty stomach. Hence, we suggest using it with your breakfast. 
#5. Ecdysterone

Sponsored and By MD Media.

SHOP ECDYSTERONE
Like turkesterone, ecdysterone has gathered lots of lovers in the bodybuilding community over the last few years. Also like turkesterone, it’s a type of ecdysteroid found in plants.
Otherwise known as 20-hydroxyecdysone, it’s a powerful naturally-occurring compound for building muscle.
As studies show, it increases muscle protein synthesis by 20% and has proven to be even more effective than steroids and synthetic SARMs for packing on lean mass.
Ecdysterone was compared to Dianabol, SARMs, and Dienedione, showing considerably higher potencies than them all. Considering that those compounds are known to be insanely effective for muscle building, the potential for ecdysterone is massive.
A test involving 46 participants looked at ecdysterone’s performance-enhancing impacts over a ten-week period. One group took ecdysterone, and the other took a placebo every day for the duration.
The group who took the supplement increased their one-rep maximum bench press and squat by 19.4%! That’s a huge improvement in just ten weeks, concluding that ecdysterone is highly effective at boosting strength and quickly gaining muscle mass.
How to Use Ecdysterone
The majority of studies were conducted with dosages between 50mg and 500mg per day for a period of three to 12 weeks. The results show that higher dosages reap better strength and size.
However, it’s still effective at doses as low as 12mg per day.
We recommend taking 5mg per kilogram of body weight. For instance, a person weighing 90kg would take 450mg of ecdysterone per day.
#6. Beta-Alanine

Sponsored and By MD Media.

SHOP BETA ALANINE
Beta-alanine is a type of amino acid applauded for its fatigue-reducing effects and notable improvements in exercise performance. And yes, it also helps increase muscle mass, provided you are following a proper weightlifting regime.
However, it’s unlike most amino acids in that your body doesn’t use beta-alanine to synthesize proteins. Instead, it mixes it with histidine and creates carnosine, which is kept in your skeletal muscles.
Carnosine limits the build-up of lactic acid, allowing you to perform better throughout the entirety of your workout and lengthening the time it takes for you to feel fatigued. Therefore, promoting muscle growth through increased exercise intensity.
In 2011, researchers conducted a study on the effects of beta-alanine on college football players and wrestlers.
The results? Taking 4g of the supplement every day for eight weeks boosted their lean body mass.
Another study showed that, when added to a six-week program of HIIT (high-intensity interval training), beta-alanine increased lean muscle mass by one pound more than the placebo.
Despite some studies suggesting there’s no change in body composition when supplementing beta-alanine, we’ve certainly noticed positive changes in our builds and muscle masses. So, we just had to include it on our list.
How to Use Beta-Alanine
The typical dose of beta-alanine is between 2g and 5g per day.
Research suggests that taking the supplement with a meal can further enhance carnosine levels, improving effectiveness.
#7. KSM-66 (Ashwagandha)

Sponsored and By MD Media.

SHOP KSM-66
If you’re even a little bit into fitness, you probably expected to find most of the supplements on this list. But KSM-66 or ashwagandha probably didn’t come to mind.
Sound like you? You aren’t alone! Ashwagandha is an herbal supplement rooted in ancient times. And frankly, we don’t think it gets the love it deserves.
Made from the roots of the Withania Somnifera plant from India, it’s most well-known for reducing stress and anxiety-related symptoms. However, its lesser-known impacts on testosterone, glucose, and strength make it a fantastic supplement for muscle growth.
Cortisol, known as the stress hormone, is produced by the adrenal glands, playing a vital role in metabolism, immune system functioning, and energy regulation during stressful scenarios. It’s a response that has been with us since we lived in caves.
Even though we’re unlikely to be eaten by a lion in the developed world, our 21st-century stressors elicit the same response. And while it can be useful, high cortisol levels promote fat storage, muscle breakdown, and ineffective recovery.
But that’s where ashwagandha comes in to save the day by mediating the negative effects of increased cortisol levels. Specifically, it:

lowers serum cortisol by 27%.
increases testosterone by 17%.
lowers bad cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose.
boosts good cholesterol and DHEAS.

In short, it supercharges your gym sessions!
How to Use KSM-66 (Ashwagandha)
Ashwagandha capsules have dosages between 450mg and 2g. You can take it in a single dose with food or split it across two means.
Like most herbal supplements, the effects take a while to show, even when taking them daily. However, we recommend starting with a low KSM-66 dosage to see how you feel before moving on to higher, potentially more effective amounts.
How We Picked The Best Supplements for Muscle Growth
By now, you’re well-equipped with the seven best supplements for muscle growth. However, you’re probably wondering how we arrived at our recommendations, right?
Well, we picked the products because they ranked highly in every single category below:
Ingredients
The ingredients are crucial. After all, they quite literally make up the entire supplement. So, if the ingredients aren’t high-quality, neither is the supplement itself.
For each product we tested, we looked at the ingredients and researched whether there was any scientific data to back up their inclusion. Thus, you can rest easy knowing that everything we recommend contains top-notch ingredients bolstered by science and proven to work.
In short, you’ll get real results from using the supplements we suggest.
Effectiveness
If it doesn’t work, we don’t want it, and neither should you.
We asked ourselves, have we actually seen results? And for all the products we mentioned earlier, the answer is yes. We can safely say they all make a solid impact.
Reviews
We always check to ensure we aren’t the only ones who love the product. Every supplement we mention here has worked for us and loads of other people around the world.
So, the chances of it working for you are incredibly high (as long as you follow the recommended dosages and follow a workout/nutrition plan).
Safety
It isn’t all about effectiveness — the supplements need to aid muscle growth safely to make it onto our list. All the products we mention are safe and won’t cause adverse side effects.
Value
Finally, we consider the supplement’s value for money. We ensure it’s fairly priced, high-quality, and actually worth the cost.
Are Muscle Building Supplements Safe?
As a healthy individual, muscle building supplements are 100% safe to take and don’t cause any adverse side effects. You can even take multiple at the same time.
That said, you should always read the manufacturer’s instructions regarding dosages and never exceed the recommended per-day amounts.
If you have any health or medical concerns, we suggest consulting your doctor before beginning supplementation of any kind. They will be able to tell you whether it’s wise for you to use the product.
This is especially important if you take prescribed medication!
Do You Need to Take Supplements to Build Muscle?
Technically no; you don’t need to take supplements to build muscle if you eat a high-protein diet. However, they are extremely helpful in supporting the muscle building process, allowing you to see results quicker than without supplementation.
So, if you have the budget for it, we highly recommend stocking up on a range of supplements for muscle growth to help you reach your goals faster.
PS: We mention an especially effective stack for gaining lean mass in the FAQ section later.
4 Extra Tips to Help You Build Muscle Mass
Remember, supplements are useful for supporting your efforts. Unfortunately, they aren’t miracle products for building mass without any work on your part.
So, here are a few extra tips you can follow to grow your muscles:
#1. Do Progressive Overload in the Gym
Progressive overload is when you increase the number of reps, weight, or frequency of your weightlifting regime. It challenges your body and avoids plateauing, helping you efficiently improve strength and, thus, mass.
Doing the same workouts over and over again or utilizing the same weight each time can lead to plateauing. While it will feel good easily lifting weights that you once found difficult, you won’t be making any progress — performance-wise and physique-wise.
That’s where progressive overload comes in to switch things up and make it challenging again. It’s the difficulty that promotes gains and builds muscles.
We know it’s a cliche. But there’s a reason why the quote, “change begins at the end of your comfort zone” exists — because it’s true. You won’t put on mass if you’re chucking easy-to-move weights around.
And there are studies to back it up, such as the 2011 test published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology.
It looked at the effects of a 12-week bicep-focused progressive overload regime on 83 people. The researchers found that the program increased bicep growth and strength in men and women.
#2. Make Sure to Eat Enough Protein
As we mentioned earlier, protein is the foundation of your muscles. So, when trying to build mass, you must eat more than enough protein. Otherwise, your muscles won’t have what they need to grow.
We recommend aiming for 0.8g to 1g of protein per pound of body weight from high-protein foods like:

Eggs — A large egg contains 6.3g of protein.
Almonds — One ounce provides 6g of protein. Other high-protein nut choices include pistachios and cashews.
Chicken breasts — Half a chicken breast offers 26.7g of protein.
Cottage cheese — It’s low in fat and calories, but one cup provides a whopping 28g of protein.
Greek yogurt — A seven-ounce container offers 19.9g of protein. Other great yogurt choices include kefir and unsweetened low-fat yogurt.
Milk — One cup provides 8.32g of protein.
Lentils — Half a cup of cooked lentils offers 9.02g of protein, making them a great option for vegans and vegetarians.
Lean beef — Three ounces provides 24.6g of protein.
Fish — A fillet of white cod offers 41g of protein, while half a salmon fillet contains 30.5g. Really, all fish are high in protein!

#3. Lift Heavy and Lift Intensely
Lifting heavy and intensely is a surefire way to reach your physique and performance goals when coupled with proper nutrition (and supplements).
We recommend focusing on compound movements so you can experience total-body results.
These exercises work numerous muscle groups at the same time. Not only does this save you time in the gym, but it also:

improves overall fitness, strength, and aesthetics.
burns more calories.
improves intramuscular coordination.
enhances flexibility.
raises your heart rate.

The most popular (for good reason) compound exercises are:

Deadlifts for targeting forearms, lats, glutes, hamstrings, core, and back.
Squats for targeting quads, glutes, and calves.
Bench press for targeting chest, shoulders, and arms.
Lunges for targeting glutes, quads, calves, and hamstrings.
Dips for targeting the chest, shoulders, triceps, and abs.

#4. Prioritize Your Recovery
Sleep isn’t for the weak. It’s very much for the strong.
Your muscles grow when you rest. So, getting seven to eight hours of sleep per night is essential when trying to grow mass.
Muscle Building Supplements FAQ
Do you still have questions about muscle building supplements? This section was made just for you.
How Fast Do Muscle Building Supplements Work?
The answer to this common question is largely dependent on the particular product. Usually, it takes at least seven days to notice any effects, regardless of the supplement type you’re using.
Have a look at the table below to find out the average time it takes to start seeing results per supplement we discussed earlier:



Supplement Type
Time to See Effects


Creatine monohydrate
Two to four weeks


Whey protein powder
Eight weeks


BCAAs
Ten days


Beta-alanine
At least two weeks


Turkesterone
Two to four weeks


Ecdysterone
One week


Ashwagandha
Two weeks



Can You Stack Muscle Building Supplements Together?
Absolutely! It’s completely safe to stack multiple of the products we’ve mentioned to further enhance muscle growth, body composition, and performance.
For building mega mass, we highly recommend stacking creatine, beta-alanine, and whey protein powder in the following way:

Creatine — 3g to 5g before and after workouts
Beta-alanine — 1g to 2g before and after workouts
Whey protein — 20g before workouts; 20g to 30g after workouts

Depending on the flavors of your powders, you can throw your before and after workout amounts into one, easy-to-drink, convenient shake!
Conclusion: The Best Supplements For Muscle Growth
Taking one of the seven best supplements for muscle growth we suggested — creatine monohydrate, whey protein powder, amino acids, turkesterone, ecdysterone, beta-alanine, or KSM-66 (ashwagandha) — will significantly quicken and enhance your fitness journey. We’ve tested them all for effectiveness, science-backed ingredients, safety, whether others like them, and value for money.
However, you need to combine supplementation with adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and a worthwhile workout regime to see the results you expect. Unfortunately, you won’t gain lean mass by sitting on the couch!
Ideally, you should focus on progressive overload and compound movements like deadlifts, bench presses, dips, lunges, and squats for optimal results.
Once you’ve got your exercise routine and nutrition down, you can include supplements to aid and enhance your hard work.
Remember, you can stack the supplements we recommended for increased effects. We particularly recommend stacking creatine (3g to 5g), beta-alanine (1g to 2g), and whey protein (20g to 30g) for mass.
And lastly, be patient! Results from these supplements can take a while to kick in.

			I know your clients work very hard on a daily basis to build more muscle and burn off excess body fat. They more than likely pre-prep all of their meals, carefully strategize their supplement regimen and make sure to hit the gym either before or after work/school between 4 and 7 days per week. However, sometimes it becomes necessary to adjust their routine if they are planning a short or extended visit away from home. In these cases, they may not have access to a commercial gym full of fancy machines, be able to prepare or weigh their food, or even have the time or ability to consume every meal exactly on schedule. However, this does not mean giving up, giving in, or simply accepting that they will have to take a few steps backward. By making a few well-thought-out and intelligently planned tweaks to their diet/workout/supplement program not only can you prevent your clients from going backward but may even find them making additional progress during their time away!
Here are some of the strategies you can utilize with your clients to keep their physical transformation routine on track, even when obstacles, or travel, try to throw them off-track.
Diet
When at home it is easy to control all aspects of one’s diet. Your clients can make a quick trek to the market when running low on food. They can prepare all meals under a watchful eye in their own kitchen. And they can precisely measure out all of their nutrients to make sure proteins, carbs and fats are exactly where they need to be. However, while away, one may not have access to all the foods they regularly consume, the necessary tools or time to cook their meals, or even the ability to stick to their regular eating schedule. they may have no choice but to eat on the run, rely on rapid “feedings,” and/or consume food from restaurants or what can be found at social or work events. So, while sticking to one’s exact nutritional regimen may be impossible in these situations, it does not mean your clients cannot still eat in a manner that allows them to at least maintain the look of their physique.
Coach’s Suggestions for Your Clients

Have them carry protein powder, water and a shaker cup with them wherever they go so they never miss out on a protein meal.
Have them take easy to carry/eat foods with them to use as healthy snacks or additions to protein powder such as nuts, seeds, fruit, grain bread and rice cakes.
Advise them when eating out, try to fill 1/2 of their plate with a quality protein, ¼ with a healthy carb and ¼ with a vegetable.
Remind them when eating out ask for all foods to be prepared without added butter or high calorie sauces.
Have them put a timer on their watch to go off every 2-3 hours so they know it’s time to get in a productive meal of some kind.

Sample Day

Meal 1: Egg Whites, Turkey Bacon, Whole Grain Toast
Meal 2: Protein Powder, Fruit
Meal 3: Salad with Chicken Breast, Rice Cakes
Meal 4: Protein Powder, Nuts
Meal 5: Steak, Vegetables
Meal 6: Protein Powder

Supplements
Obviously when your clients are at home, they can use a wide array of products to create an all-inclusive and maximally effective supplement regimen. However, when on the road traveling, or away on vacation, it is not necessary for them to take the entire kitchen pantry along in its own suitcase. With that said, there are certain nutritional supplements that should always remain in one’s program, which will help keep them on track no matter how many miles from home they must venture.

Training
It’s always smart for your client to call ahead when traveling in order to find out if there is a local gym that provides daily or weekly passes to those who come from out of town. Depending on what hotel he/she may be staying at, one might also find that they have a fitness center with enough equipment to get in solid workouts while away. However, in those cases where there are no gyms available or not enough time to take away in order to travel back and forth, you can still make sure your client’s muscles get the stimulation they need with nothing more than a pair of exercise bands and one’s own bodyweight.
Sample Workout
The below is meant to be performed as a “circuit,” so he/she will move from one exercise to another without rest. This will allow them to work the muscles while raising the heart rate for an added cardiovascular effect.

Wide Grip Push Ups…15 Reps
2 Arm Bent Over Band Row…15 Reps
Bodyweight Squats…25 Reps
Band Upright Row…15 Reps
Band Curls…12 Reps
Alternating Bodyweight Rear Lunges…12 Reps Per leg
Band Triceps Kickbacks…12 Reps
Bicycle Crunches…20 Reps Per Side
Bodyweight Single Leg Stiff Leg Deadlift…10 Reps Per Leg

*No rest to be taken between exercises (or as little as possible)
**Rest 3-5 minutes once full circuit is complete. Repeat circuit 2-3 more times.

Artigo 8,"
			Sometimes it can be confusing determining which nutrition experts you can trust. When it comes to eggs, one study finds them good for you, and then next one calls them dangerous. So which ones are right.
Although this back-and-forth, widely-debated topic can be confusing, determining whether an egg will raise your cholesterol or clog your arteries comes down to your lifestyle, health conditions, what you eat daily, and more.
Here’s an example: one large egg contains 212mg of cholesterol, which is a lot compared to most food. This is where the cholesterol misconception comes in, according to Jacob Klessens, RD, LD, CPT, who’s here to talk about the Jacob Klessens, RD, LD, CPT.
Your liver produces cholesterol every day, and the amount of cholesterol produced depends on how much you eat, making dietary sources of cholesterol to have minimal effects on body cholesterol. So, if you get a lot of cholesterol from food, your liver will produce less. If you don’t eat foods with cholesterol, your liver produces more of it. On top of that, studies show that eating dietary cholesterol has no link to heart attacks or strokes.
While too much of one thing can be bad, staying away from eggs completely due to fear of your cholesterol rising, especially when you practice clean eating, will have you missing out on some of the best nutrients on the planet.
tiverylucky
Egg Misconceptions (Clearing up Cholesterol Myths)
Klessens explains that the view on eggs has changed many times over the last five or so decades, and it can be somewhat hard to keep up with. “One day you hear that you shouldn’t eat eggs because they are super high in cholesterol, the next, they are perfectly safe to eat,” he says. We’ve all seen the runaround.
Yes, eggs do contain a high amount of cholesterol, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are bad for you. “Eggs have many health benefits, not to mention they are delicious, so cutting them out completely is unnecessary,” says Klessens.
He explains that “If you are someone who is watching their cholesterol, you will want to limit your cholesterol intake, which can be done through eating fewer eggs or eliminating other animal products that are high in saturated fats.” He recommends incorporating good sources of soluble fiber into your diet as it will help decrease LDL levels, if that is something you are concerned about.
Egg-cellent Health Benefits
From a solid source of protein to vitamin and mineral-packed, eggs should have a seat at the table every day. “Eggs have many health benefits, one of the most known is that they are a great source of protein, containing an average of six grams of protein per egg,” says Klessens.
“Cooked eggs are also one of the most bioavailable protein sources you can consume sitting at 91%, second to whey protein,” he says. This means the body can utilize the protein extremely well – A bonus for those tearing muscle fibers in the gym day in and day out.
Klessens explains eggs also contain a wide variety of vitamins such as B6, B12, and vitamin D, which are important for maintaining a healthy nervous and immune system, producing red blood cells, and supports bone health and muscle growth.
And let’s not forget thyroid-supporting minerals, which are known to boost overall health and energy levels. “Eggs are a great source of selenium, which is important for thyroid support, reproduction, and protecting the body from free radicals,” Klessens says making this protein choice a must for both men and women. And what’s even better is, the same nutritional profile applies to the yellows—aka yolks!
Don’t Be Afraid to Get Yolked
Time to rewire your thinking, Klessens says—egg yolks aren’t the enemy. In fact, there are many health benefits to eating egg yolks. “People often think that the egg white is the only part of the egg that contains protein, however, that is not true,” he says. “Egg yolks actually contain a couple of grams of protein as well, along with healthy unsaturated fats, and vitamins A, D, E, K, and B vitamins,” he explains. All vitamins needed to keep you healthy and strong while providing a tasty breakfast (or dinner) option.
How Many Egg Yolks Should You Eat? According to recent studies, consuming one-to-two whole eggs per day appears to be safe to include in a healthy diet. “This number will vary for everyone depending on their health status and other foods they consume throughout the day, but that is the best answer,” says Klessens. Working with your PCP will best help you understand what’s going on inside your body, how your liver is working, and if eggs should play a role in your diet as a regular guest.

Two Egg Hacks You Need in Your Life (How to tell if an egg has gone bad)

Crack it and inspect the spread: Klessens recommends cracking the egg open and see if the egg white has a watery appearance. “If it spreads out quickly across the pan, that could indicate the egg is old but doesn’t necessarily mean it is bad.” Says Klessens. Keep in mind, If the egg has any sort of discoloration or sulfur smell to it, that typically means the egg has gone bad. · Perform the Float Test:
Gently place your egg(s) in a bow of water: If the egg sinks, it’s fresh, if tilts upward or floats, it’s most likely gone bad.

Eggs Purchasing Tips:

Egg color is determined by the birds’ genetics, not one color is better than another.
Always buy organic eggs. (If you can). If you don’t have a farm close by, ask your local grocery store clerk if they can provide more information on the eggs you wish to buy.
If you purchase from a meat market or local farmer, eggs do not need to be refrigerated for a few months. (If they haven’t been refrigerated already). These eggs will most likely come unwashed. Once you wash the eggs, they need to be refrigerated. The eggs can happily sit on the counter and not in the fridge due to the protective layer on their eggshell that keeps it from going bad. Washing them removes this protective layer.

Why Going Organic (Or pasture raised) Matters When Buying Eggs
Egg prices are through the roof right now so the thought of buying organic/pasture-raised eggs (or investing in them at this point) might make you cringe. Here’s why choosing organic and or pasture-raised matters.

Organically raised birds are fed feed that is Certified Organic, and free of GMOs, antibiotics, heavy metals, hormones, animal by-products, and pesticides. The USDA regulations require organic birds to have year-round access to the outdoors, not cooped up in unhealthy living conditions.
Pastured raised birds roam freely, eating from nature; seeds, grasses, and insects. (Making much healthier and happier birds and producing higher egg quality). These birds are fed feed but in small amounts and have been shown in studies to have higher vitamin D levels due to the fact these birds roam freely in the sun. · Both Organic and pasture-raised eggs are higher in vitamins A and E, and omega-3 fatty acids than conventional eggs.
Conventional eggs are the standard supermarket eggs. Conventionally raised birds are fed feed that most likely contains GMO soy, corn, and pesticides. These birds’ living conditions are unknown, however, they are supplemented with vitamins and minerals.
‘Cage-Free’ is quite similar to conventional –The birds that lay cage-free eggs still get their beaks and wings clipped and live in close quarters with minimal sunlight (and no guaranteed access to the outdoors). Hence, egg quality suffers and the birds may as well.
Free Range Eggs are produced from birds that ‘may’ be permitted outdoors. The term “free-range” may be used differently depending on the country and the laws, (and is not regulated in many areas).

Don’t Forget Duck Eggs
Duck egg, chicken egg, what’s the difference? They’re both good for your body.
Although not normally found at your local grocery stores, duck eggs are significantly larger than chicken eggs (sometimes), sitting close to two times the size. “Because of this, one might think that a duck egg has double the protein as a chicken egg, but that is not true,” Klessens explains. On average duck eggs contain 9g of protein compared to 6g found in chicken eggs. “However, the duck egg contains a much larger yolk making it have about 10g of fat per egg compared to five grams found in chicken eggs,” Klessens explains.
That said, if you like the creaminess, taste, and size of a duck egg compared to a chicken egg but want to skimp on the fat, you can simply consume one duck egg instead of two chicken eggs.
Don’t fear a bigger egg: Duck eggs contain as much as 168% (or more) of the daily value for Vitamin B-12 making this protein source a great choice for sustained energy, building DNA, and creating new blood cells. Plus, duck eggs are a baker’s best friend adding volume, creaminess, and richness to many baked goods.
TIP: When purchasing any type of eggs, research the company (or even contact them) and see how they raise their hens, what they feed them and how much roaming they do. Free-range doesn’t always mean free range, cage-free doesn’t always mean cage-free. Some brands might be better than others allowing you to save money while consuming a healthier egg option.
The Bottom Line
If you can’t go organic, or go pasture raised don’t stress. Egg prices will come down. If you are wanting to go the healthiest route, specialty stores, farmers markets, and meat markets may have a healthier selection of eggs, even if you live in a city. Some meat markets, specialty stores and farmers markets purchase their eggs from farmers that live out of the city providing city dwellers with cleaner egg options.

			Since being selected with the No. 22 pick in the NFL Draft, Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson has been nothing short of special. His ascent to the best receiver in the league status has only continued this season in historical fashion.
In November, Jefferson eclipsed Randy Moss’ record for receiving yards in a player’s first three seasons.
He’s already locked up the NFL Play of the Year Award, and recently broke Cris Carter’s record of 122 catches in a season with 123 and counting. And with two games remaining, he’s now just 209 yards away from breaking Calvin Johnson’s NFL record of 1,964 receiving yards in a season.
Oh yeah, and he was a significant contributor in the Vikings completing the greatest comeback in league history, as they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in overtime 39-36 after being down 33-0 at halftime.
Check below as the All-Pro receiver gives Muscle and Fitness a glimpse into some of his favorite training gear.

			Ever scroll through social channels and health-related news articles and see common clickbait titles like “how to lose 10 lb. in 7 days” or “shed fat fast”? After reading them, is the advice extremely vague or the solutions aren’t sustainable lifestyle changes? 
Well, what if there was just ONE thing you could change about your diet TODAY, that would immediately improve your health, and help “shed” fat without making ANY other changes to your daily routine? 
Sound too good to be true…? Well it is NOT. It is a scientifically proven method. 
The secret is protein. 
Protein is a combination of various amino acids that make up all the structural tissues in the body. For health and fitness enthusiasts, protein is loved for its ability to build and maintain muscle. However, many people overlook the many other benefits it provides such as improving appetite control and shedding body fat. YES, various studies have shown that increased protein intakes not only benefit lean body mass but help decrease fat mass stores. How? Well protein has a very high thermogenic effect during digestion, meaning it takes a significant amount of calories to digest protein. Additionally, it is nearly impossible for protein to be converted to fat… it’s just not an easy metabolic fate for protein after it has been digested. 
However, a recent study just showed why just increasing protein intake can be the SINGLE intervention you make to see SIGNIFICANT improvements in your health and body composition. 
This study looked at the effects of a high protein (1.8g/kg) vs low protein (0.8-1g/kg) euenergetic diet (diet matched to maintain weight) on 47 normal weight obese women for 12 weeks with ZERO exercise intervention. Women were healthy, had to have a BMI greater than 18.5 but less than 25 kg/m^2) or body fat percentage of 30%, and between the ages of 30-60 years. After 12 weeks, the high protein diet group on average lost 2 lbs of body fat and gained 3 lbs of muscle! There were no significant changes seen in the low protein group. 
Lost body fat, and gained muscle with ZERO additional exercise interventions. All these women did was increase their protein intake. That is a phenomenal result.
Takeaway? Increasing your protein intake can be the single intervention you can make to drastically improve your health by increasing your muscle mass, decreasing body fat, promoting immunity, and decreasing risk for injury. 
How much protein should you aim to consume then? 
Ideally, significant increases in muscle mass are not seen with intakes above 1.6g/kg body weight in most individuals. Therefore, a good baseline could be 1.6 up to 1.8g/kg per day based on the findings from the study above. What does that look like? Take an individual that weighs roughly 150 lb. Divide 150 by 2.2 to yield weight in kg and multiply that value by 1.6 and 1.8 (68.2 kg x 1.6 = 109 grams or 68.2kg x 1.8 = 122 grams). 
Three servings of 30g of protein per day plus 2 snacks with roughly 10 grams of protein each would easily satisfy the daily protein requirement needed for someone weighing 150 lb. 
So protein alone is the magic formula for actually shedding body fat and building muscle in an easy and healthy fashion.
