Examples of animal-based proteins include casein, whey, collagen, soy, and egg. Plant-based protein powders often contain pea, rice, or hemp protein. Some vegan blends also contain whole grains, nuts, and seeds.\\n\\nProtein powders contain either animal-based or plant-based protein sources.

The type of protein powder you choose depends on your dietary needs, health goals, and personal preferences, such as: Whey: Whey is a milk-based protein that’s quickly and easily digested and absorbed. When combined with resistance training, whey protein may help increase muscle mass, support growth, and speed post-workout recovery, so it’s a great choice for athletes ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ).\\n\\nWhey is a milk-based protein that’s quickly and easily digested and absorbed.

Casein: Casein is a protein in milk that is digested and absorbed slowly, which can help you feel full longer, so it may help reduce your appetite. The slower digestion and absorption rate may also support muscle growth and recovery over longer periods ( 11 , 12 ).\\n\\nCasein is a protein in milk that is digested and absorbed slowly, which can help you feel full longer, so it may help reduce your appetite.

Collagen powder: Collagen is a component of muscles, and supplementing with it may help stimulate muscle growth when combined with resistance training ( 13 , 14 ).\\n\\nCollagen is a component of muscles, and supplementing with it may help stimulate muscle growth when combined with resistance training ( , ). Plant-based: People following a vegan lifestyle should opt for plant-based protein sources such as pea or brown rice. These can also be suitable for people who follow a dairy-free diet or have trouble digesting dairy or lactose (15, 16). Concentrate vs. isolate vs. hydrolysate The specific form of protein may also be important to consider. Whey protein, in particular, is available in concentrate, isolate, or hydrolysate form, although many supplements contain a combination of the three. Although whey concentrate and isolate offer similar benefits, whey protein isolate undergoes processing methods that result in a higher concentration of protein and lower amounts of fat, carbs, and lactose. As such, it may be a better option for people who are limiting their consumption of fat, carbs, or lactose. Meanwhile, whey hydrolysate, or hydrolyzed whey, has been partially broken down to ease digestion and speed absorption ( 17 ).\\n\\nHow to use protein powder Keep in mind that protein powder should not be used to replace healthy sources of protein in your diet because high protein foods also provide other valuable nutrients, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Still, supplements can be an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake, as there are many ways to use protein powder. The simplest way is to mix it with a beverage, such as water or milk, or blend it with other ingredients, such as fruits and veggies, to create a smoothie. You can also mix protein powder into simple foods such as yogurt, oatmeal, or dips. If you feel like getting creative, you can experiment with using protein powder as an addition or substitution in your usual recipes. For example, you can use protein powder in soups, veggie burgers, pancakes, and baked goods. Timesaving tip To save time, make a larger portion of smoothie mixture and freeze it to make individual ice pops. Was this helpful? When is the best time to take protein? The best time to take protein powder depends on your health goals. You may want to have one large portion or several small portions of protein per day. To lose weight: Try incorporating more high protein foods throughout the day, as studies show that increasing your intake of protein could help reduce appetite and cravings ( 18 ).\\n\\nTry incorporating more high protein foods throughout the day, as studies show that increasing your intake of protein could help reduce appetite and cravings ( ). To improve athletic performance or endurance: When to consume protein powder largely depends on your overall fitness goals. While some studies show a benefit of consuming protein prior to aerobic exercise, research suggests that the amount of protein you consume throughout the day is more important than the timing ( 19 ).\\n\\nWhen to consume protein powder largely depends on your overall fitness goals. While some studies show a benefit of consuming protein prior to aerobic exercise, research suggests that the amount of protein you consume throughout the day is more important than the timing ( ). To build muscle: It’s generally recommended to consume protein powder within 2 hours of a weightlifting session. Some research also suggests that taking protein powder before you go to sleep may help your muscles recover overnight. But research shows that daily protein intake is the most important factor in muscle building ( 20 , 21 ).\\n\\nIt’s generally recommended to consume protein powder within 2 hours of a weightlifting session.

But research shows that daily protein intake is the most important factor in muscle building ( , ). To prevent muscle loss: Focus on eating moderate amounts of protein throughout the day to help prevent muscle loss in older adults ( 22 ).\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of using protein powder? Protein powder can be a quick and convenient option to increase your protein intake. This may be especially beneficial for people who have increased protein needs, have difficulty meeting their needs through food sources alone, or have certain dietary restrictions, such as a vegan or vegetarian diet. Many athletes take protein powder after exercising, which may help enhance muscle growth and speed up post-workout recovery ( 20 ). Additionally, enjoying a protein shake or high protein snack may even support weight loss by increasing feelings of fullness between meals ( 18 ).\\n\\nIs protein powder safe? Protein powders are generally well tolerated and have few side effects, so they are safe for most adults. However, certain types of protein may affect you, especially in terms of digestion. Certain types of protein can cause gas, bloating, or stomach cramps. Skin reactions are also possible. Some supplements could contain contaminants, such as yeast or bacteria, which can cause foodborne illness ( 23 ). They may also contain heavy metals, which can negatively affect the health of your kidneys, brain, thyroid gland, and reproductive system if consumed in large amounts ( 24 ). Choosing a high quality product that has undergone third-party testing for purity and potency can help minimize the risk of contamination with these harmful compounds. If you have a medical condition, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or take any medications that could be affected by protein powders, talk with a healthcare professional before using one.\\n\\nFrequently asked questions Are protein powders regulated by the FDA? The FDA regulates supplements, including protein powders, as food products rather than medications, meaning that it doesn’t evaluate supplements for effectiveness or safety ( 25 ). For this reason, it’s especially important to choose a product that is third-party tested or certified whenever possible. Are protein powders good for you? Protein powders can be a helpful addition to an overall balanced diet by helping you bump up your protein intake to meet your health goals. In particular, increasing your protein consumption may support weight loss, muscle growth, and post-workout recovery ( 18 , 20 , 26 ). Additionally, some products contain essential nutrients that may be helpful if you’re unable to meet your nutrient needs through diet alone. With that said, not all products are created equal, and some could potentially expose you to heavy metals and other contaminants. Always make sure to purchase a product that has been thoroughly tested for purity and potency, ideally by a third-party lab. Which protein powder is best for beginners? Gainful is a great option for beginners, as it creates a custom protein blend based on your dietary needs and fitness goals. What’s more, you can mix and match the Flavor Boosts to find what works for you. Each subscription also includes personalized nutrition advice from a registered dietitian. Which protein powder is best for muscle gain? If gaining muscle mass is your goal, research suggests choosing a product with at least 20 g of high quality protein and minimal fillers, sweeteners, and artificial ingredients ( 20 ). Though any of the protein powders listed above can support muscle gain when paired with resistance training, Naked Whey Protein Powder is a particularly great option that is low in carbs and provides a concentrated dose of protein in each serving. Is whey protein better than plant-based protein? Plant-based protein can be a great option for vegans and people who are unable to tolerate dairy. However, whey and plant-based protein powders offer a similar set of health benefits. In fact, some research suggests that whey protein and plant-based protein can be equally effective at increasing muscle growth and strength, as long as they contain the same amount of protein and branched-chain amino acids — a group of amino acids that boost muscle building — per serving ( 27 , 28 , 29 ). What is the best protein powder for weight loss? Whey protein is a great option for weight loss, as studies have shown that it could improve body composition when paired with resistance training ( 7 ). Plant-based protein powders can also be a good dairy-free alternative if you’re trying to lose weight. According to one small study of 30 people, whey protein and pea protein were similarly effective at reducing appetite and daily calorie intake when consumed as part of a high protein breakfast ( 30 ).\n",

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission Here’s our process .\\n\\nTherefore, the supplements on this list are appropriate for any healthy adult, regardless of gender.\\n\\nIt’s also important to note that while many of these pre-workout supplements are marketed toward women, the products are not formulated to meet women’s specific nutritional needs.\\n\\nBCAAs have been shown to increase muscle growth and decrease muscle soreness, though more research is needed ( 13 , 14 ).\\n\\nBranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are a group of three essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine.\\n\\nCreatine is one of the most studied supplements in the fitness industry and has been shown to improve both muscle strength and weightlifting performance ( 12 ).\\n\\nIf increasing strength is your top priority, look for a pre-workout supplement that includes creatine .\\n\\nWhile some studies suggest that it boosts nitric oxide production, L-arginine has not been found to benefit exercise performance, as it’s broken down before it reaches the bloodstream ( 10 , 11 ).\\n\\nL-arginine is another amino acid that’s frequently found in pre-workouts, either on its own or with L-citrulline.\\n\\nL-citrulline is another amino acid to look for, as it has been shown to boost nitric oxide production, which improves blood flow to the muscles. As a result, your muscles can receive more oxygen and more nutrients to support muscle performance and growth ( 8 , 9 ).\\n\\nHowever, beta-alanine can cause a harmless tingling sensation that some individuals dislike.\\n\\nAnother common ingredient is beta-alanine — an amino acid that research suggests may prevent the buildup of acid in muscle tissue, allowing your muscles to work harder ( 6 , 7 ).\\n\\nWhile caffeine has been shown to improve strength and athletic performance, some individuals may be more sensitive to caffeine’s stimulant effects ( 4 , 5 ).\\n\\nWhen looking for a pre-workout supplement, women should consider the specific ingredients, as some have been shown to be more effective than others. Additionally, some ingredients may cause unwanted side effects.\\n\\nNote that the serving recommendations vary between 1 and 2 scoops.\\n\\nGenerally, prices range from $0.66–$1.90 per serving, or $19.99–$49 per container, though this may vary depending on where you shop.\\n\\nGeneral price ranges with dollar signs ($–$$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher cost.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it may be best to avoid some ingredients because of potential side effects or dietary preferences. For example, you may prefer to avoid:\\n\\nIngredients you may want to look for a pre-workout product include:\\n\\nFinally, given that stimulants affect everyone differently, we recommend starting with a smaller dose of any caffeinated pre-workout supplement to assess your tolerance.\\n\\nTherefore, it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before trying any new supplements ( 15 ).\\n\\nWhile pre-workouts are considered safe for healthy adults, certain ingredients are not recommended for those who take certain medications or are pregnant or breastfeeding.\\n\\nPre-workout supplements may help boost your energy levels and improve your athletic performance. However, not all supplements are created equal. Here are some factors to consider.\\n\\nBest natural pre-workout\\n\\nPrice: $\\n\\n$ Active ingredients: beta-alanine, creatine monohydrate, L-arginine, caffeine\\n\\nNaked Energy is not only certified gluten-free and vegan but also free of soy, dairy, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners.\\n\\nPlus, it has been third-party tested by Eurofins Scientific, so you can trust the quality of its ingredients.\\n\\nSpeaking of ingredients, Naked Energy includes 200 mg caffeine, which is equivalent to approximately two 8-ounce (237-mL) cups of coffee.\\n\\nIt also contains beta-alanine and creatine, making the supplement a great choice if you’re looking for a pre-workout to boost your energy levels and help build muscle.\\n\\nHowever, it includes L-arginine rather than L-citrulline, so you likely won’t reap any improved blood flow benefits.\\n\\nIf the unflavored version is too natural for your taste, this supplement also comes in a fruit punch flavor that’s sweetened with pure cane sugar and natural flavors.\\n\\nMany customers agree that the taste isn’t the best, but its simple, natural ingredients and effectiveness more than make up for it.\\n\\nPros third-party tested\\n\\ncertified gluten-free\\n\\nvegan-friendly\\n\\nfree from soy, dairy, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners\\n\\naffordable Considerations not the best tasting\\n\\nnot suitable for those sensitive to caffeine Was this helpful?\\n\\nBest caffeinated\\n\\nPrice: $$$\\n\\n$$$ Active ingredients: L-citrulline, beta-alanine, betaine anhydrous, caffeine anhydrous, L-theanine\\n\\nIf you’re a seasoned caffeine drinker, this pre-workout may give you the kickstart you’re looking for. That said, if caffeine isn’t your thing, 1 of the 10 flavors (green apple) is caffeine-free.\\n\\nIf you do opt for a caffeinated flavor, each 2-scoop (24.2-gram) serving contains 350 mg of caffeine.\\n\\nKeep in mind that an 8-ounce (237-mL) cup of coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine, so it’s not a bad idea to try a one-half serving first to assess your tolerance before going all in.\\n\\nThe rest of the ingredient list makes this pre-workout supplement ideal for both strength and endurance training.\\n\\nIn addition to beta-alanine and L-citrulline, the ingredients include L-theanine, which may help lessen the intensity felt by such a big dose of caffeine ( 16 ).\\n\\nFinally, you can rest assured that you’re getting what’s on the label, as this product is third-party certified by Labdoor.\\n\\nPros third-party tested\\n\\nvariety of flavors\\n\\nformulated for strength and endurance training Considerations expensive\\n\\nnot suitable for those sensitive to caffeine Was this helpful?\\n\\nBest for strength training\\n\\nPrice: $$\\n\\n$$ Active ingredients: creatine monohydrate, AstraGin proprietary blend (Panax notoginseng extract and Astragalus membranaceus), beta-alanine, L-citrulline, acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride, L-tyrosine, caffeine, citrus bioflavonoid complex\\n\\nWith 3 grams of creatine per scoop (10 grams), Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout is great if you’re looking to build muscle and strength in the gym.\\n\\nOne serving also includes beta-alanine and a more modest 175 mg of caffeine to help your muscles work harder and fight fatigue.\\n\\nOptimum Nutrition’s pre-workout is certified by Informed Choice — a third-party testing organization that specifically tests products for impurities and the presence of substances banned in sports.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that the supplement includes a proprietary blend called AstraGin, which includes Panax notoginseng extract and Astragalus membranous.\\n\\nAstraGin is considered safe for healthy adults, and it’s thought to support the absorption of nutrients in the body and boost energy levels.

When it comes to exercise, adaptogens may help fight fatigue and improve mental performance ( 23 ).\\n\\nAll Ora Organic products are third-party tested by various organizations, including Eurofins and JK BioScience Analytical Laboratories, and certificates of analysis (COAs) are available to allow customers to view testing results.\\n\\nBased on reviews, customers appreciate the company’s testing process and use of high quality ingredients.

However, L-arginine is broken down before it reaches your bloodstream, so it’s unlikely to make a difference ( 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ).\\n\\nCreatine monohydrate is also included, making this a good option for strength-based workouts ( 12 ).\\n\\nLastly, Do Vitamins Pure Pump contains alpha lipoic acid, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that may be beneficial in improving muscle recovery, though more research on its effectiveness as a pre-workout is needed ( 26 ).\\n\\nThis pre-workout is also certified vegan and third-party tested by Labdoor.\\n\\nPros third-party tested\\n\\nunflavored and lemon flavor available\\n\\ndesigned for strength training Considerations expensive Was this helpful?\\n\\nBest gluten-free\\n\\nPrice: $$\\n\\n$$ Active ingredients: sodium, vitamin C, vitamin K1, vitamin B12, cane sugar, baobab, coffee fruit extract, emblic fruit extract, spinach, beet root, kale\\n\\nGarden of Life SPORT Organic Plant-Based Energy is made from real food ingredients and is certified vegan and gluten-free.

processo de fabricação do queijo, ele possui aminoácidos essências de rápida absorção que ajudam na construção/recuperação muscular e na síntese proteica. Devido ao seu alto valor nutricional o Whey protein se mostrou um forte aliado de quem busca fontes de proteínas saudáveis.\\n\\n- Qual Whey devo tomar?\\n\\nExistem 3 tipos de Whey Protein que se encontram no mercado: concentrado, isolado e hidrolisado, entretanto, cada um deles atende cada necessidade especifica de um indivíduo.\\n\\nConcentrado : Passa apenas por uma filtragem e é o mais utilizado para quem não tem nenhum tipo de restrição com a lactose, ele possui de 30% a 80% de concentração de proteína e o restante de sua composição de carboidratos, lactose, gordura e minerais.\\n\\nIsolado : É o Whey protein indicado a quem tem intolerância à lactose ou algum transtorno digestivo. Por conta dos seus altos processos de filtragens ele acaba se tornando um whey mais puro e acaba sendo alvo daqueles que procuram uma proteína com menor percentual de carboidratos e maior concentração de proteínas.\\n\\nHidrolisado: É também indicado transtornos digestivos e intolerância a caseína. Passa pelo processo da quebra da molécula, da hidrolise, que facilita a digestão e absorção da proteína e é o whey com a absorção mais rápida do mercado\\n\\n- Quando e como tomar Whey Protein?\\n\\nÉ recomendado que o Whey Protein seja consumido logo após a prática da atividade física para que possa ajudar na recuperação muscular e potencializar o ganho de massa muscular, mas ele pode ser utilizado ao longo do seu dia a dia para ter a manutenção de massa muscular, por exemplo: naquela refeição que você não teve condição de consumir qualquer fonte de proteína.\\n\\nPode ser tomado em forma de shake diluído em 200ml de água ou leite, com a porção conforme for descrito no Whey utilizado. Quando diluído em leite integral o Whey protein se torna mais gorduroso, porém, haverá um aumento na concentração de proteína.\\n\\n- Whey Protein engorda?\\n\\nWhey Protein pode te engordar se tiver o consumo excessivo e de forma errada do produto, por ser uma fonte de proteína ele é importantíssimo para o auxílio de massa muscular, aliado a atividade a física e a uma dieta equilibrada, não há riscos de engordar.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Quais são os benefícios do Whey Protein?\\n\\nAumento da imunidade\\n\\nControle do diabetes\\n\\nAumento de força e de construção dos músculos\\n\\nReduz o risco de doenças hepáticas e cardíacas\\n\\nAjuda na recuperação em pós operatórios\\n\\nRedução do Apetite\\n\\nAuxiliar em dietas\\n\\nControle da hipertensão arterial\\n\\n- Quem pode tomar Whey Protein?\\n\\nCom certeza o maior público do Whey Protein são de atletas ou pessoas que praticam algum tipo treinamento, mas também pode ser utilizado por idosos, gestantes, indivíduos que tenham alguma carência de nutrientes que estão presentes na composição do Whey. Só existe contra indicação para quem tem problemas renais, doenças crônicas e alergia a lactose.\\n\\nREFERÊNCIAS\\n\\nhttps://www.essentialnutrition.com.br/conteudos/whey-protein/\\n\\nhttps://www.scielo.br/j/rn/a/PRpChxDqt3YYYvkN8KFRDmS/?lang=pt\\n\\nhttps://www.gsuplementos.com.br/whey-protein-concentrado-1kg-growth-supplements-p985936\\n\\nhttps://www.danonenutricia.com.br/adultos/alimentacao/whey-protein--o-que-e--para-que-serve-e-como-tomar\n"
