																									The Best Fitness Supplements You Should Be Using
																								
											
																								
													Among so many different supplements today, it’s very hard to pick one that really does the job done as advertised when they all promise you they will help you burn fat, increase muscle or make you healthier. So if you are just starting out or you don’t know what works and what doesn’t – here are the best fitness supplements you should be using for losing fat, building muscle and better health.

The 8 best fitness and health supplements
1. Whey protein
Whey protein is probably one of the best fitness and health supplements and the first thing you need to consider supplementing with when you start bodybuilding or any other demanding physical activity.
It is a quick and convenient way for everyone who wants to consume some quality calories from protein and reach daily protein needs. Because whey is a complete protein and also high in branched-chain amino acids, it will aid recovery from exercise and improve your immune system.

2. Fish Oil
Fish oil is a miracle supplement as it promotes muscle growth, fat loss, improves mood, reduces high blood pressure and triglycerides at the same time. The most responsible component for these benefits is the alpha-linolenic acid (Omega- 3) found in fish oil.
Omega 3 contains the two fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These are acids that cannot be synthesized by our body and need to be taken as a supplement or with the food. When buying fish oil, seek for a brand that delivers at least 1.8-2g of EPA and DHA with the daily dose.
3. Probiotics and prebiotics
Probiotics are the good bacteria that live inside our gut and are directly responsible for our digestion and immune system. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are the food of our gut bacteria. Increasing the prebiotics intake will also increase our “good” bacteria numbers in the intestines.
More probiotics in our intestines means that the food we eat will be better digested and used by our body. When buying probiotic supplements look for a product that lists at least 3 billion micro – organisms per serving.
4. Vitamin D
Vitamin D deficiency of  is manifested trough a few symptoms, such as muscle weakness, depression, weak immune system and certain skin conditions. In order for the skeletal muscle to function properly you need vitamin D.
Unfortunately it’s very hard to get the quantities of this vitamin only from the food you eat and sun exposure. This is why it’s important to supplement your diet with around 1000 UI of vitamin D a day.

  
        
          
          
        
    


5. Creatine
This is one of the most studied bodybuilding supplements for the last 20 years or so. It’s a supplement that works without a doubt. It gives you more strength and energy during intense exercise and increases muscle mass. You consume creatine when you eat red meat, but that’s in very low doses – around 3-5 grams per 2 lbs of red meat.
There are a few types of creatine on the market, but nothing beats the good old creatine monohydrate. When taking creatine you would want to start with 5-10 grams a day (depending on your weight), divided into two doses.

6. L-Carnitine
L-carnitine is an amino acid that is produced in the brain, liver, and kidneys. It helps the body turn fat into energy by transfering long-chain fatty acids, such as triglycerides into mitochondria, where they may be oxidized and used for energy production, meaning that glycogen is spared during exercise. In other words – you burn fat while your energy and strength levels stay increased.
A good start is to take 2 grams of L-carnitine a day divided into two 1-gram doses, one of which, will be taken before an intense workout.
7. Cinnamon
This spice has the ability to control blood sugar, by eliminating or moderating blood sugar levels and insulin spikes. Keeping the blood sugar levels low is the main element of fat loss. For a start you can sprinkle cinnamon on your oatmeal, on fruit, on your dessert or in your shakes. Start with 1-2 grams of cinnamon a day.
8. Magnesium and Zinc
Magnesium has many roles in the body, and is required for many enzymatic reactions, including those involved in the synthesis of fat and protein, neurological activity, muscular contraction, cardiac activity and bone metabolism.
Zinc is also important for many processes in the body like protein synthesis, immune system  functioning, blood sugar control, growth etc.
When combined, these two minerals increase the production of testosterone – one of the most anabolic hormones in the body. There is also a pre-formulated product called ZMA (Zinc monomethionine aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate and Vitamin B6) that may improve testosterone levels, sleep and recovery.

																									ZMA Supplementation and Testosterone
																								
											
																								
													Of all the anabolic hormones in the body, testosterone is without a doubt considered to be one of the strongest. It comes as no surprise then that the hormone has been linked to a wide variety of bodily functions such as increases in muscle mass, memory, libido and concentration.

That being said, for athletes, the main aspect of concern about testosterone are its anabolic properties. Without this particular hormone, all of the sweat, blood, and hard work in the gym would be for nothing.
One could literally do all the work in the weight room for hours on end, every day and not gain one pound of muscle without this necessary hormone. Of course this goes both ways though, meaning that an excess of testosterone will translate to greater output in the gym.
If a person’s body is not producing an adequate amount of the hormone, their gains will most certainly suffer because of it. Keeping this in mind, athletes have to do everything in their power to regulate their testosterone levels, and keep them high.
Improved levels of testosterone
Lacking in just one area, whether it be micro nutrients or macro nutrients intake and especially sleep, your gains will suffer from it! That also goes for testosterone levels and growth hormone as well. There are two minerals that should you should be focused on, particularly because they both have such an immense impact on the body’s ability to recover and grow from training.
Zinc
If you have a deficiency with this mineral then you are effectively sabotaging all of the effort you put in at the gym! Being deficient in this mineral means that your muscle strength and endurance will decrease.
Not only does zinc promote tissue repair, boosts immune system, boosts muscle growth and healing but it also optimizes insulin and the all-powerful testosterone in healthy male individuals!
In addition to all of this, the enzymes that prohibit the buildup of lactic acid (aka the fatigue acids) require zinc in order to properly function. Sound like something not to be messed with? Exactly, this is why it is such an important mineral. Here is a list of some foods high in Zinc.
Magnesium
Having a magnesium deficiency decreases the delivery of oxygen to the body’s muscle tissue. Magnesium is of course known for promoting endurance and strength, but it has also been confirmed to encourage relaxation as well.
Another reason why you don’t want to find yourself lacking this mineral is that it stimulates enzyme activity that is required for the body to metabolize amino acids and carbs.

  
        
          
          
        
    


The facts about these two minerals
It has been revealed by numerous studies that the majority of people who eat “self-selected” diets are only getting lower than two thirds of what the recommended daily intake for zinc is.
The same goes for magnesium, with even less people getting the appropriate levels. Those studies were primarily conducted on non-active people, and it is a fact that athletes and people who lead active lives deplete their mineral stores much faster than others. Several studies have shown that zinc and magnesium stores are depleted within a few days after strenuous activity.
What is ZMA ?
ZMA is a supplement that combines these two essential minerals (Zinc and Magnesium) with Vitamin B6. Some studies claim that it can optimize testosterone levels, however other studies claim that ZMA will not raise testosterone in individuals with normal and healthy levels of this hormone.
Where ZMA supplements can help is in individuals with lowered testosterone levels (1, 2).
Other benefits of ZMA supplementation
It can improve sleep and recovery
Studies indicate that taking zinc supplements could enhance the quality of your sleep (3), while magnesium can activate your parasympathetic nervous system (4), aiding in relaxation before bedtime. Additionally, studies show that magnesium helps with melatonin (a hormone responsible for normal sleep cycles) regulation.
It can boost immunity
Studies suggest that adding zinc supplements to your diet can, lower the risk of infections, boost the immune system, and aid in fighting colds and the flu (5, 6). Additionally, magnesium can lower inflammation (7) while vitamin B6 is needed for the production of antibodies that fight infections (8,9).
Other solutions for low Mineral Intake and Depletion
The obvious solution to this problem is to supplement your diet with both zinc and magnesium. The following guidelines should be adhered to however.
– Take this at least 30 minutes before heading off to bed, and be sure you take it on an empty stomach too. It is recommended to wait about an hour or two after eating before taking the supplement.

  
        
          
          
        
    


Zinc’s effect on the body is maximized during the sleep cycle, which makes sense because the body does go into repair mode when the mind sleeps. In fact, the biggest surge of growth hormones occurs during the time right after going to bed (approximately 1.5 hours into sleep).
Now, because testosterone, insulin, magnesium and zinc all increase the effects of growth hormones, it makes sense to take the supplement around bedtime for maximum absorption.
– The dosage should be as followed: 450mg of Magnesium and 20-30mg of Zinc
– Do not take any form of calcium supplement coupled with zinc and magnesium! Mainly because calcium competes for maximum absorption, so it is best to stick with one or the other.
Understanding Supplementation and its Benefits
1.    Increases in both muscular endurance and strength
2.    Decreases in length and timing of muscle pulls and cramps
3.    Heightened level of healing ability and injury recovery
4.    Higher levels of alertness and overall concentration
5.    Lowered retention of water
6.    Improved level of relaxation when sleeping
Final thoughts
The only way to train is to go all out in the gym, period! Having that attitude of course comes with the added responsibility of managing your body’s recovery abilities. Pay special attention to lacking areas in your diet, and today we went over one of the main aspects many overlook. An aspect that if left alone, will certainly slow gains and wreak havoc on the body which for any self-respecting athlete is enough reason to take mineral intake seriously!

																									Six Natural Fat Burners To Speed Up Fat Loss
																								
											
																								
													Imagine having a six-pack. It’s almost the first thing that pops into anyone’s mind when they image their ideal body. Everyone strives for a perfectly chiseled torso, broad shoulders, huge arms, and well-defined legs. It takes a lot of hours of hard work in the gym, consistency and dedication in the kitchen to achieve all of that.

And unless you are a professional fitness model or bodybuilder surrounded by nutritionists and trainers helping you every step of the way and getting huge sponsorships, it will be extremely hard to find the time and motivation to carve out the body sculpture of your dreams.
However, a lot has changed lately. The entire bodybuilding game has changed with all the breakthroughs in supplement development and supplement companies have released powerful fat burner supplements that can get you to the six-pack ab look you are after, much faster.
That’s not to say that fat burning supplements are any kind of magic pills that will give you instant results and transform your body into a Greek sculpture. As with everything in life, if you want to achieve something worthwhile you need to put in the work.
Let’s assume that you have been on a cutting diet in the last few months, but you’ve still got those last extra pounds you need to get rid of, you know, the most stubborn piece of flab that no matter how hard you try it you can’t lose it on your own. You might wonder why?
When diet is your only strategy there is a limit to how much fat you can lose, after which you reach a plateau. In order to bust through that plateau and reach a body fat level that will expose your abdominal muscles, you will need some extra help.
The help you seek comes in the form of fat burners which are healthy and natural. You can take them in their natural form or you can ingest them via fat burner supplements.
Here are some of the advantages of natural fat burners:

They get you ripped by shredding off the troublesome fat spots faster.
They can raise your energy levels while you are on a low-calorie diet.
They can inhibit food cravings with the help of powerful suppressants of appetite.

What are the main benefits of natural fat burners ?
The first, obvious benefit is helping you burn fat faster. Fat burners are actually supplements with a complex structure and they use a few different processes to help the body lose the excess fat.
1. Natural Fat burners boost thermogenesis
The first process is called thermogenesis which is also one of the best methods of the newly developed and improved fat burning supplements. The ingredients added in these supplements will raise the metabolic rate, which in turn will make your body burn a lot more calories than you would otherwise do naturally.

  
        
          
          
        
    


The most defining principle in regards to losing weight is the number of calories you consume versus the number of calories you burn. That’s the simplest advice you could get and often the most helpful.
2. They raise your energy levels
The second process by which fat burners help you burn fat is by raising your energy levels. Losing the excess fat can be very tiresome and put a great burden on your body both physically and mentally, especially when you are on a cutting diet.
What’s good about natural fat burning supplements is that many of the ingredients in them elevate your body’s overall levels of energy that will help you push through those low-energy periods occurring when you are on a restricted diet.
3. Natural fat burners suppress appetite
The third process is appetite suppression which is a relatively new addition in fat burners of higher quality. The main ingredient causing this is a fibrous complex that helps your body stop craving foods that are high in calories and resisting the urge to binge on junk food.
The supplement market has seen a tremendous increase in fat burner supplement demand and an increasing number of companies have started competing and releasing new products.
However, lots of those same companies are advertising their products saying there is some special ingredient in them that separates them from all the rest and offering better results when in reality it’s nothing more than good marketing and the added ingredient has hardly any value.
6 natural ingredients added to fat burners
In order to clarify the confusion as to which ingredients work and which don’t, we have compiled a list of clinically proven ingredients which will help you make an informed choice and be on the lookout for ineffective ones:
Caffeine
One of the most common ingredients in natural fat burners. Everyone knows caffeine’s effects when drinking a cup of coffee, but little does anyone know, is that caffeine gives you a huge boost to your metabolism at the same time you get the “buzz”. It’s an essential ingredient to keeping your weight low and energy high.
Green tea
Green tea is considered the best drink to help weight loss, aside from coffee. It is a natural healthy stimulant raising energy levels. What’s more, compounds called catechins that are found in the plant release the hormone norepinephrine in the body which has fat burning effects and gives a boost to the thermogenic process which speeds up the weight loss.

  
        
          
          
        
    


Hot peppers
Hot peppers are incredibly powerful when it comes to giving the body a thermogenic boost. The cayenne pepper was shown to be especially powerful. Chili can raise the body’s natural temperature which forces the body to burn calories in order to lower it. This particular pepper has also been found to greatly suppress appetite.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is one of the essential nutrients to our survival. It is also an effective weight loss tool in that it suppresses appetite. Studies have shown that Vitamin D and Calcium can dramatically decrease appetite. That’s why adding a right dose of vitamin D to your weight loss diet is essential for success.
Glucomannan
This ingredient has become the latest advancement in natural fat burners. Glucomannan isn’t used for weight loss however, the other ingredients do that. Glucomannan is actually a root rich in fiber that is found in the Konjac plant. After being ingested, it swells up in the stomach and makes you feel fuller and helps absorb all the nearby fats.
Green coffee bean extract
It is not widely known that raw coffee beans are rich in fat burning ingredients. In their unprocessed form the beans have high levels of chlorogenic acid, which is excellent for lowering glucose levels in the liver and decreasing fat deposits. What it does is it inhibits an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate.
Some of the ingredients listed have been added to fat burner supplements since they first appeared. However, a great deal of them were mixed with slightly dangerous components that were meant to raise the metabolic rate. Research has shown that this could be really harmful to one’s health and can lead to a lot of medical issues.
The majority of the most popular fat burners use all the possible ingredients they can add to give them an edge in relation to their competing products by raising energy levels, elevating the metabolic rate and suppressing appetite.
You should always keep this in mind the next time you’re out to buy a fat burning supplement. Always pay attention to the nutrition labels and carefully examine the ingredients.

																									The Only 4 Muscle Building Supplements You’ll Ever Need
																								
											
																								
													The fitness supplement industry is making billions every year with countless supplements being put on the market, causing a real headache for people who are beginners and just starting out with fitness on what the best choice is.
The fact is that many of the supplements are not needed, and won’t help you much, except if you need that little edge. Buying them will only make supplement companies richer and nothing more.

The majority of people have so many questions buzzing through their heads on what to take, how much to take, is it too much, is it enough. A lot of conflicting information, many outrageous claims, it’s a real mess.
People get so caught up in this process that they fail to realize that the number one priority aren’t supplements, but a sound nutrition plan. The name itself says it. They are meant to supplement your diet, not comprise the bulk of it. That’s why you need to have a good diet plan first and then worry about what supplements to choose.
Your diet should already be comprised of healthy foods, like lean meats, vegetable, and fruits. After you’ve sorted out your diet and have chosen a good workout routine, you are ready to look into proper supplementation that will help you achieve your goals faster.
This article is meant to help you do just that. To sort out the mess and point out the only supplements that are worthwhile and take you to your ideal physique as fast as possible.
1. Omega-3 fish oil
It has already been proven that while we consume more than enough omega-6 fatty acids in our diet, the fact is that almost everyone is deficient in omega-3.
Taking omega-3 fish oil will not only improve your performance in the gym, it will also improve your overall health, as evidenced by hundreds of studies. Taking into consideration that our bodies can’t take enough omega-3 from seafood, we are required to start taking a supplement which will give us the sufficient amount
Taking omega-3 will provide you with numerous benefits like decreased inflammation, increased heart health, improved cognitive functions and decreased chances of depression development.
It’s important to note that before you buy an omega-3 fish oil supplement you should first examine the label. Choose the product that has a high content of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid).
These two acids will improve the functionality of cells’ membranes, especially the DHA, decrease the chances of developing a cardiovascular disease since it’ll decrease oxidative stress and will relieve depression since the two acids are precursors to the feel-good hormones, dopamine, and serotonin.

  
        
          
          
        
    


If you can’t seem to find an omega-3 fish oil supplement, try any of the following foods which are full of it and will give you (almost) the same benefits: salmon, spinach, flaxseed, walnuts or chia seeds.
2. Multivitamins
Multivitamins have all the micronutrients that our bodies need in order to function properly. When buying a multivitamin, you should make sure that it contains these vitamins: Vitamin A, B, B12, C, D, E, and K. Every vitamin has its own unique benefits. Here are some of the benefits of each of the vitamins:
Vitamin A: Increases the health of your bones and their proper growth.
Vitamin B, as well as B Complex: Increases the production of energy and general energy output.
Vitamin C: Improves the immune system and improves the production of nitric oxide.
Vitamin D: Functions in synergy with calcium to create healthy bones and teeth. It’s also known to prevent certain illnesses.
Vitamin E: Decreases the amount of “bad” cholesterol.
Vitamin K: helps in making various proteins that are needed for blood clotting and the building of bones.
Taking a multivitamin which includes all of the vitamins above will have a tremendous positive impact on your overall health. Additionally, it will lead to improved performance in the gym.
Vitamin D
We’ve reserved a special place for Vitamin D. Vitamin D is also a crucial micronutrient to your diet and chances are you are deficient in it. Well, at least, depending on where you live. You might ask why location is a factor here. That’s because vitamin D is available through the Sun’s rays.
Despite it being found in products like egg yolks, beef liver and certain types of fish, it’s very likely that you don’t like these foods and don’t want to eat, let alone ever considered to include them into your diet. Which leaves you with the most abundant source of Vitamin D, our Sun.
What if you’re living in a country that doesn’t  have many sunny days? Are you doomed? Of course not. That’s why we have the Vitamin D supplement. Unless, of course, you weren’t planning on moving to a sunnier country.
3. Creatine Monohydrate
Creatine Monohydrate is perhaps one of the most debated supplements in the industry. The debate is usually about its effectiveness or alleged side effects. Within the fitness community itself, there have always been various opinions, with some claiming that it is a harmful compound, especially for younger people. Despite the fact that everyone has their own opinion, or should we say, superstitions, this is simply not the case with creatine.

  
        
          
          
        
    


Creatine monohydrate is a substance that is naturally found in our bodies which helps with the ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) production. ATP is an energy source which our bodies use when we are experiencing short and intense muscle contraction bursts which make it ideal for resistance training.
Basically, ATP is required for any muscular contraction. If the muscle needs to contract more during a lifting set, then more ATP is used. Taking creatine monohydrate will increase ATP availability and will create more effective muscle contractions. What’s more, it has become a popular notion that taking creatine monohydrate will force your body to hold too much water which will give you a ‘bloated’ look. Again, not true.
While it’s true that creatine will use water, it will use it to your advantage. The additional creatine will take the water and pull it inside the muscle cell, increasing its efficiency while creating a fuller and loaded muscle. This can be very convenient for people who are on a cutting diet and don’t want to look too slim. A generally recommended dose for men and women alike is 5 to 10 grams a day.
4. Whey protein
Whey protein is the most important supplement one could implement in their diet. If you are wondering what supplement to buy first, always opt for whey protein.
Whey protein is actually a byproduct of dairy and the most common form you can find on the market is whey protein powder which is most commonly mixed with some kind of liquid (water, milk, juice, fruits) to make a delicious protein shake. Protein consumption is the most important dietary rule for all those looking to experience maximal muscle gains.
It is very important that you measure your total protein consumption on a daily basis. What you should strive for is consuming one gram of protein per one pound of your bodyweight. Of course, this intake recommendation can change based on your level of physical activity, one gram per pound is the general recommended daily dose.
For many people, trying to hit their daily protein goal is a hard task, which is why whey protein consumption is an excellent and convenient way to get fast-digestible protein at any time, any place. We recommend you try our two suggestions below on how to make delicious protein meals:

Whey protein shake: Mix one to two scoops of your favorite protein taste with half a liter of liquid, like milk or water. The best time to consume this meal is one hour to 30 minutes after working out, to feed your starved muscles with fast-acting protein or whenever you like as a meal replacement so that you can reach your daily protein goal.
Protein porridge: Some would call this the perfect breakfast. First, take a bowl and add the preferred amount of oats in it and mix it with water thoroughly. Once you’ve given it a good mix, put it in the microwave and let it cook for two and a half minutes until it gets a smooth texture. Afterward, add some berries, one whey protein scoop and one tablespoon of peanut butter. Total calories for this meal are 390, protein content is 32 grams, carb content is 40 and fat 13.
Protein ice cream: Mix together two whey protein scoops, 500 grams of low-fat cottage cheese and whatever fruit you want most. Our suggestions are any kind of berries and bananas. Put the mixture into a Tupperware and put it in the freezer for two hours until it becomes solid. Then, take it out of the freezer, take the lid off and stir it to make sure that the blend is frozen evenly. Repeat this until the blend is ready.


  
        
          
          
        
    


Conclusion
As we said previously, once you have your diet and training dialed in, you can then start adding certain supplements if you want to achieve your desired goals faster. Just as with anything related to fitness, taking them on a consistent basis will yield the best results. If you are to experience their full benefits, you must take them at a regular time. Always be accountable for your actions to yourself, be consistent in everything you do, enjoy the journey, and success is guaranteed.

							HomeFitness and Health9 Tricks to Look Bigger Instantly										
											
																									9 Tricks to Look Bigger Instantly
																								
											
																								
													Although we know that muscles don’t grow over night, there are some tricks that can help you boost their size in no time. First, let’s get something straight: there is no alternate route to building size and strength. It takes time, hard training, proper dieting and quality supplementing.
However, there are times when you want to instantly increase your size by a fraction of an inch. That, on the other hand, can be helped. Learn how to fill your muscles with water and make them look bigger. In this article, we will show you 9 tricks that will help you put on a couple of pounds of size.

1. Stay Hydrated
It all begins with water and staying optimally hydrated. There are numerous studies that point out that dehydration is one of the most common problems among athletes. In fact, one of them suggests that less than 15% of all athletes are sufficiently hydrated. Drinking sufficient amount of water is absolutely crucial if you want your muscles to look big.
THE MECHANISM: When your body is sufficiently hydrated your muscles are filled with water and they appear big.  On the other hand, insufficient hydration results in reduced amount of water in our muscle cells and they appear flabby and smaller although no muscle mass has been lost.
THE METHOD: The solution to this problem is fairly simple: start drinking water now. The recommended intake is one gallon of water every day, but you can increase this amount by about 30-40%.
2. Boost Your Carbs Intake
One of the fastest foolproof ways to bulking up is to increase your carbs intake. This approach delivers the best results in people who don’t usually consume too much carbs, i.e. those who eat less than one gram of carbs per pound of bodyweight daily.
THE MECHANISM: When we consume carbohydrates, our bodies store them in the muscle cells as glycogen. One of the properties of glycogen is that it draws large quantities of water into the muscles cells, making them bigger.
HOW TO DO IT: First deplete your body of carbs as much as you can by reducing their daily intake to 1/2 grams per pound of bodyweight for three days.
Next, increase your daily carbs intake to 4 grams per pound of bodyweight one or two days before you want your muscles to look their biggest.  To avoid turning the excess carbs into fat, consume simple carbs in the morning and complex carbs later during the day. 
You can consume simple carbs like sugar and white bread during the first 4-6 hours when your metabolism works the fastest. Switch to sweet potatoes, oatmeal, whole-grain bread, or to some other source of complex carbs latter in the day.

  
        
          
          
        
    


3. Choose Your Creatine
Consuming carbs is not the only way to pull water into your muscle cells. This can be also achieved by consuming creatine, which performs a similar function as the glycogen in terms of hydrating the muscle cell.
However, if you are looking for instant muscle growing results it’s better to go for fast-acting creatine instead of using creatine monohydrate. Although the effects of creatine monohydrate are just as impressive, the drawback of its use is that it takes time to show results.
That is why it’s better to opt for creatine hydrochloride or Kre-Alkalyn. These two formulas deliver almost instant results, making your muscles look bigger in no time.
THE DOSE: Choose one of the above mentioned creatine supplements and consume 3-5 g before and after workouts.
4. CONSUME GLUTAMINE
Although the effects L-glutamine on muscle growth may not be as instant as those of creatine and carb loading, it’s still one of the key ingredients that can help you in increasing your size.
THE MECHANISM: Being stored in the muscle cells, glutamine performs a similar function as creatine in terms of hydration: it draws water into your muscles. In addition, it also helps the conversion of glucose into glycogen, thus increasing its presence in your muscle cells, which results in increased amount of water.
THE DOSE: Consume 10 g of L-glutamine after workout with your shake.
5. Step Up your Glutamine Intake
Although consuming L-glutamine after workout will deliver certain results, you can take your glutamine supplementation one step further by consuming L-alanyl-L-glutamine. This amino increases your muscle size using a different mechanism.
THE MECHANISM: According to the research, L-alanyl-L-glutamine helps water retention in your body. And as we have already said at the beginning, water is one of the key ingredients in building up muscle size. Consuming L-alanyl-L-glutamine before workout will help you stay hydrated, and will improve your pump.
THE DOSE: Take 5-10g of Sustamine half an hour before workout. This ingredient combines L-alanyl and L-glutamine amino acids.
6. Turn To Taurine
Taurine is probably one of the best known amino acids among the general population, since it is found in some energy drinks like Red Bull.
It is found in many energy drinks which claim that it is the main ingredient that provide their energy boosting properties. However, although taurine can provide you with some energy boosting effects, this amino acid is much more efficient in helping you put on size.

  
        
          
          
        
    


THE MECHANISM: Taurine is also involved in the process of pulling water into your muscle cells, and it’s especially efficient when you combine it with glutamine and creatine. However, the additional benefit of taurine lies in its ability to increase your muscle strength, making them able to endure harder workouts, which will help your muscle growth over the long haul.
THE DOSE: Consume 2–3 g of taurine before and after workout.
7. POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTATION
Although potassium is not unknown ingredient in athletes’ lives, most of them use it for replenishing their energy levels.  However, this electrolyte has another important function. It can help you increase size in no time.
THE MECHANISM: Potassium simulates the volumization of muscle cells by drawing water into them. This effect is especially evident in people that have typically low potassium levels. Since most of the bodybuilding diets rely on limiting the fruit intake, potassium supplementation works especially good.
THE DOSE: Consume 500-1000 milligrams of potassium with your food several times during the day.
8. Glycerol Supplementation
Glycerol is a polyol compound which is primarily found in the triglycerides. It can be very effective in increasing the muscle size due to its hydroscopic property.
THE MECHANISM: Glycerol is soluble in water and it also draws and binds large quantities of water in our muscle cells. We’ve already mentioned that the increased water quantities in your muscles make them look bigger and fuller. In addition, glycerol helps you stay hydrated for a longer period of time, and participates in controlling your body temperature. According to the research, you can have the best results by combining glycerol with creatine, lots of water and fast burning carbs.
THE DOSE: As glycerol can cause digestive problems in people with sensitive stomachs, start by taking lower doses. Consume 40 grams of glycerol combined with 15 grams of carbs, 5 grams of creatine and 70 ounces of water. If you find that you have no problem with an increased dose, you can double that amount.
9. Boost your muscles with Nitric Oxide
Nitric oxide is a simple molecule that provides your body with a numerous benefits ranging from improving your erectile ability to boosting your brain functions.
In addition, many bodybuilders use it for shortening the recovery period after intensive workout. The main ingredient in NO boosters is arginine – an amino acid that can be converted into nitric oxide into our bodies.

  
        
          
          
        
    


THE MECHANISM: Nitric oxide is a powerful vasodilator. It helps your blood vessels relax, thus widening their diameter and increasing the blood flow. As a result, greater amount of blood comes to the muscles.
Assuming that you’ve already provided your body with glycogen, creatine, glutamine, taurine, potassium and glycerol, this increased quantity of water will swell up your muscles to their maximum.
Another benefit of increasing the blood flow is the increased supply of oxygen and other nutrients to your muscles.
THE DOSE: We recommend taking NO booster according to the recommended dose on the label 30-60 minutes before every workout and every morning.

																									7 Herbs That Can Help You Lose Weight
																								
											
																								
													Those who tried can tell you that losing weight is a though job. You need plenty of exercise, strict diet and most important – a strong mental attitude to go through the whole process.
There are, however, a few tricks you can do to make it easier on yourself. A number of herbs and spices can actually help you speed up the fat-burning process.

Besides adding flavor to your meals, herbs and spices can also influence your health, as they contain antioxidants, minerals, vitamins and unique medicinal properties.
Some of them can even help you boost your metabolism and lose weight, so you might want to consider adding them to your daily supplement plan.
Herbs for weight loss:
1. Ginger
This herb is commonly used in cooking various dishes, but it can also be used as a weight loss supplement.
A lot of research has been done on ginger and scientists have shown that this root can suppress appetite and detoxify the body, helping you lose a few pounds in the long run. You can use ginger tea, ginger ale or take a ginger supplement.
2. Cayenne Pepper
Did you know that hot foods can be beneficial to your health and can boost weight loss ? Capsaicin is a substance found in hot foods such as cayenne and chili peppers, giving them the ability to produce burning sensation in your mouth.
Capsaicin is also known to help fight obesity by shrinking fat tissues, as well as triggering protein changes in the body.
Another important thing you need to know about capsaicin is that it has thermogenic properties. It slightly increases the temperature of your body, increasing the metabolism by about 4-5 percent. You can get the benefits of capsaicin by adding a cayenne or chili pepper in your meals or if you prefer – use a hot sauce.
3. Guarana
Guarana is a herb containing diuretics, which are known to promote the production of urine.  By losing bodily fluids you also lose weight. The secondary characteristic of guarana is the ability to stimulate the nervous system and help you cope with stress, which in term helps you avoid emotional eating, one of the main causes of weight gain.
4. Cinnamon
The sweet tasting, great smell plant you usually use in some dishes can also help you lose fat. It does that by regulating blood sugar levels and insulin spikes.
Cinnamon  was found to significantly reduce blood sugar levels, triglycerides as well as LDL cholesterol. You can sprinke cinnamon on your meals, put some in your tea or use a cinnamon supplement.

  
        
          
          
        
    


5. St. John’s Wort
Commonly used as an anti-depressant in people suffereing from depression, this herb can be also used as an appetite suppressant. St. John’s Wort  reduces appetite, fights stress and calms you down, taking your mind off food for several hours at a time.
6. Mustard Seeds
The mustard plant is actually a cruciferous plant (the same family as broccoli, cabbage and brussels sprouts). Mustard works the same way cayenne peppers do. It raises body temperature and boosts metabolism up to 25 percent.
7. Green Tea
The secret of green tea lies in the fact that it’s rich in catechin polyphenols, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Studies have shown that catechins in green tea help to inhibit the movement of glucose into fat cells. Green tea may also act as a glucose regulator. In other words it helps to slow the rise in blood sugar after a meal.
There are also studies showing that green tea can increase the production of human growth hormone, which is responsible for rejuvenating the body and keeping it fit and healthy.
If you can’t stand green tea’s taste you can add a green tea supplement to your stack.

							HomeLose Fat7 Reasons You Should Add MCT Oil to Your Nutrition Regime										
											
																									7 Reasons You Should Add MCT Oil to Your Nutrition Regime
																								
											
																								
													A lot of people may be petrified of the idea of having to consume saturated fat. And they can’t be blamed since it’s been said for years now that all types of fat cause lots of health issues and having a diet low in fat is the most optimal method to lose weight and be healthier.
But nothing can be further from the truth. The fact is that if you eat the right kind of fats, in which saturated fats are included, you’ll experience many benefits like losing weight, improved immunity system, as well as improved cognitive function.

Over the past few years, coconut oil has become a staple ingredient in most healthy diets, since it offers so many health benefits. It has numerous healthy fatty acids which make our bodies function optimally and at their highest potential.
Besides the numerous healthy fats, it also contains the best of them all: medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs.
These fats are also known as MCFAs (medium-chain fatty acids) and are extremely powerful when it comes to maintaining a normal weight, improving brain health, and providing steady, long-term energy to sustain you throughout the entire day.
Coconut oil is not being called a “superfood” for nothing, since it’s made up of approximately 63% MCTs, and is one of the main reasons why MCT oil in its pure form is becoming increasingly popular among the general population.
Why is MCT oil beneficial to our health?
Fatty acids can be put into three categories based on the molecular length of carbon atoms connected to hydrogen atoms: short-chain that have less than 6 carbon atoms, medium-chain that have between 6-12 carbon atoms and long-chain that have between 13-21 carbon atoms.
The medium-chain triglycerides are digested more easily by our digestive system than long-chain. And when they’re consumed, they are immediately sent to the liver, which creates a thermogenic process which fires up the metabolism, which in turn allows the body to use the medium-chain triglycerides as a form of direct energy instead of depositing them as fat tissue.
Numerous studies have shown that lots of people who eat a standard western diet, which makes up the majority of people in the US, are deficient of MCT oils in their diets.
The low-fat diets propagated today among the population as ideal for the functioning of our bodies, are actually causing us harm. According to nutrition experts, we need to incorporate these healthy saturated fats into our diets.
7 benefits of consuming MCT oil:
1. MCT oil helps you maintain your weight within healthy boundaries
MCTs tend to suppress the appetite and have a positive impact on the metabolism, by increasing the metabolic rate quite rapidly instead of our bodies storing them as fat tissue.

  
        
          
          
        
    


While they’re being used as an energy source, they release the stored fat cells as they rev up the metabolism. MCTs are excellent at burning fat. Plus, they can help regulate blood sugar levels, and make sure you keep your sanity when the sugar cravings start creeping up.
2. MCTs make you feel more energetic
Since MCTs aren’t stored by the body as fat tissue, as soon as you eat them, they are being used as an energy source. Add some in your morning coffee or prepare a delicious coffee with a scoop of chocolate protein to give yourself an energy boost as you start your day.
3. They increase cognitive functions and make you smarter
You can look at MCTs as rocket fuel for the brain. When you consume them, they increase the number of ketones in your blood, which have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
This process gives the brain the energy it requires, which helps you be more focused, think clearly and increase the sense of well-being. The brain can’t store excess energy, so it requires a continuous supply of fuel. And, ketones are a lot more efficient for your brain functioning than glucose.
4. They improve digestion
MCTs possess characteristics which make them incredibly efficient at fighting viruses, microbes and bacteria, thus making them work wonders for the digestive system since around 70% of the immune system resides in the stomach.
MCTs make a thorough cleaning of the digestive system and help with many metabolic functions, thus combating inflammation.
5. MCTs decrease inflammation
They are filled with antioxidants, which are excellent in fighting off inflammation. MCTs keep the brain, heart, and metabolism healthy by combatting viruses and bacteria.
6. MCT oil is therapeutic
Lots of studies have shown that MCT oil help tremendously in treating hypertension, diabetes and possess numerous beneficial properties for people who had their gallbladder removed and also experience malabsorption problems. MCTs have also been shown to help in treating Alzheimer’s, cystic fibrosis, thyroid conditions and seizures.

  
        
          
          
        
    


7. The possibilities are endless
Besides consuming it, you can cook with it, use if for pulling, apply it topically or add it to your beauty regimen. The possibilities are virtually endless and experimentation will prove to be wondrous for your health!

																									4 Time Tested Workout Supplements for Ultimate Results
																								
											
																								
													Not everyone has the budget to spend an endless amount of money on supplements that are more often than not useless. That is the reason why we need to filter out the garbage and pick the ones that will be the most effective and necessary for your specific fitness goals.
You can’t expect to get the same supplements everyone else does and reach Olympic-level performance.

If you are looking to lose weight, then some off-the-shelf fat burner won’t be the be-all, end-all. The same goes for creatine if increasing strength is your goal or beta alanine if you are frequently training using high-intensity day in and day out.
First, you need to define your training goal as specifically as possible before you start considering what supplements you should take.
Besides, supplements are made with various quality and cannot be used for the same purpose. When you have defined your goals and examined the purpose of each supplement, you can then start making proper supplement combinations. Some of them have more than one  purpose, but the majority of supplements have specific ones.
In this article, we take a closer look at the four most commonly used supplements to help you get optimal results faster and look better in the mirror.
1. Creatine
Creatine is a substance that is naturally found in our bodies in small quantities and plays a vital role in our bodies’ energy system used as a fuel for workout sessions with high intensity and explosive exercises. Creatine has always been a staple supplement in various sports. It helps you build muscle, it improves strength performance and the capacity to endure longer workouts. It’s also been proven numerous times to be completely safe.
Anyone who is interested in improving their high-intensity explosive performance like sprinting, strength, power and getting lean muscle mass should start using it.
We can safely say that it is the number one supplement for building strength and muscle. It’s also been proven to be extremely effective in enhancing endurance and delaying fatigue under extreme exercise stress.
On the other hand, creatine wouldn’t be of much help for those whose training regimen consists of cycling, running or any other type of aerobic activity.
When it comes to dosing creatine, some people would like to implement dosing phases, known as a loading phase and maintenance phase. The loading phase has you taking 20 grams of creatine for 5 days after which you proceed to the maintenance phase of 5 grams per day.
This strategy purportedly saturates your skeletal muscles with creatine and enables elevated levels of creatine in your muscles to be maintained for a longer period of time.

  
        
          
          
        
    


2. Caffeine
Caffeine is a powerful stimulant of the nervous system having an effect similar to the ones related to amphetamines, albeit weaker. It is one of a small number of stimulants that have performance benefits for both aerobic and anaerobic sports, as well having the ability to boost your metabolism.
Caffeine also has the psychological effect of lowering the feeling of fatigue during intense exercise. This effect makes hard and intense exercising look much easier. It also increases endurance, which makes it an excellent supplement choice for those that love running or cycling.
Research has so far been indecisive in regards to how caffeine impacts power or sprinting performance, with some of the studies indicating that there are some benefits and others indicating no benefits at all.
Caffeine is very effective for long-lasting, high-intensity workout sessions including sports like field hockey, soccer, rowing and many others, however, it specifically works for already conditioned athletes. And lastly, it has the effect of spiking the metabolic rate while you are on a cutting diet.
When it comes to dosing, 200-300 mg per day is the most commonly used dose, with some people more tolerant to it, and some not. When it comes to training, it’s best that you consume caffeine half an hour to an hour before workout.
3. Beta-alanine
Beta-alanine is a compound that is combined with the amino acid histidine to create carnosine. Beta-alanine alone is very limited in regards to improving physical performance.
But, since levels of carnosine in the muscles are limited by the concentration of beta-alanine, beta-alanine is vital to the performance improving properties of carnosine.
Beta-alanine should be primarily used by those who are frequently training with high intensity. Anyone who uses high intensity and explosiveness exercises lasting 1-4 minutes is very likely to get the benefits of beta-alanine supplementation.
Those training using high-intensity explosive movements that last less than a minute, ( think strength training ) where maximal strength is the goal or lean muscle mass are not likely to see much benefits from beta-alanine.
Dosage should be around 6 grams per day, divided into four doses of 1.5 grams.
4. Fish oil
Fish oil has two essential fatty acids, EPA(eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA(docosahexaenoic acid). These fatty acids are essential since they cannot be created by the body itself and must be ingested via your diet. DHA and EPA are also known as omega-3 fatty acids and are the main beneficial components when it comes to supplementing with fish oil.

  
        
          
          
        
    


Early studies have not shown any indication that fish oil can increase physical performance in any way. However, several newer studies have shown that supplementing with DHA and EPA can aid in improving body composition and protein synthesis.
It’s also been shown that they are able to potentially reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which means that if your goals are to improve overall health and increase lean muscle mass you need to start supplementing with fish oil.
Dosages range from 1-4 grams per day, thus ensuring you consume at least 500 mg per day of DHA and EPA combination.

																									How the Right Dose of Caffeine Can Improve Physical and Mental Performance
																								
											
																								
													Caffeine has gotten some bad reputation over the years for allegedly being a harmful and addictive substance. It’s mostly taken via what most consider the most popular beverage, coffee.
Caffeine has been repeatedly proven to be absolutely harmless for the majority of people, as it provides numerous physical performance and overall health benefits. It is sometimes wrongly viewed by some as some kind of vice that should be reduced or eliminated altogether from our diet.

As previously mentioned, statistics have shown that coffee is the most commonly consumed beverage. One of its main properties is that it has a potent stimulating effect. And the key compound which is responsible for lots of cases of coffee addiction is none other than caffeine.
Caffeine is not that bad!
Caffeine’s bad reputation can be largely attributed to specific problematic issues that might arise. It is often seen as the main cause of sleep deprivation, increased anxiety, irritability, and stomach irritation.
All of these symptoms, however, should be more closely examined before jumping to conclusions. The smart way of consuming caffeine can significantly improve lots of good health, mental and physical performance markers.
That is unless one’s daily dose of coffee doesn’t exceed more than 5 cups or the pre-workout supplement formula is taken twice the recommended amount. Coffee consumption has been linked to decreased cancer risk, lower rates of diabetes and lower number of Parkinson’s disease cases.
Caffeine in both its isolated form or mixed in pre-workout supplements and coffee is still a potent stimulant for maximizing performance. It improves your mood, memory and makes you feel energized. Numerous studies have confirmed that people who took between 2-5 cups of coffee a day had a lower risk of experiencing cardiovascular issues.
Coffee and caffeine’s stimulating effect are “vices” that a lot of people outright refuse to eliminate from their diet since they help them go through their day and simply cannot function without them.
People who are thinking of reducing their coffee intake or eliminate it completely will be happy to know that they’d be better off continuing their drinking habit. Caffeine and its many forms can really make you feel more alive, and make you feel ready to take on the hardest job, being impervious to pain, exhaustion, and depression.

Coffee’s positive effect on physical performance and its ability to enhance one’s memory are widely known and highly revered among its countless consumers all around the world.

  
        
          
          
        
    


And even more interesting and potentially surprising to a lot of people is that caffeine possesses powerful pain-killing characteristics. Nutrition scientists have discovered that just a single cup of coffee can help diminish the pain over the short term in a matter of minutes.
One study had fifty men and women put their arms into buckets filled with ice-cold water. Initially, the men could withstand the pain longer than the women. However, after taking a caffeine dose of 250mg, the women experienced improved tolerance to the cold water and could, afterward, endure the pain longer than the men, who by the way took the same amount of caffeine.
Another study examined caffeine’s impact on ischemic muscle contraction pain, which is a specific and intense type of pain related to heart attacks. The participants were split into two groups. One group took 200mg of caffeine, the other took placebo.
After resting for an hour, they were instructed to raise their arms in order to drain the blood. Then, blood pressure cuffs were attached to prevent the blood from going back to the muscles.
They were then instructed to do wrist curls with light weights and each participant was asked to rate how much pain they were experiencing at 20-second intervals.  The group that was taking caffeine reported significantly less pain than the participants in the other group who took a placebo.
Caffeine’s powerful analgesic properties, as mentioned previously, are mostly attributed to caffeine’s ability to block the neurotransmitter adenosine, which is in charge of carrying pain signals from the nerve endings to your brain. It also activates the adrenaline pathways which are necessary to suppress pain, which in turn stimulates your body’s natural pain-killing mechanisms.
Caffeine intake also causes major central nervous system stimulation, which makes pain signals become processed in a way in which pain suppression is achieved faster. Basically, caffeine can suppress pain by giving relief to the injured area.
For lifters that often lift heavy weights, caffeine can decrease muscle soreness by decreasing inflammation levels and speed up the recovery of damaged tissues. The central nervous system is also energized with caffeine, which allows strength levels to be recovered faster after intense training sessions.
The generally recommended daily dose of caffeine is usually 100mg every few hours. This dose can also prevent the development of migraines and reduce the grueling pain.
Caffeine can help in improving focus, motivation and alertness
The famous 19th-century French playwright and novelist Honoré de Balzac held coffee in the highest esteem and praised its invigorating impact on his mental capabilities.

  
        
          
          
        
    


He said that “coffee keeps the blood moving and stimulates the muscles, it accelerates the digestive system, chases sleep away and makes us capable of engaging a little longer in our intellectual exercises”.
The effectiveness of caffeine in the form of improving motivation, alertness, reaction time, overall focus and reasoning, is absolutely crucial for those for which these properties are essential for preserving life itself.
We are referring to people in the military who often consume high amounts of caffeine and many other stimulants in order to keep their mental focus and alertness at the highest levels in life-and-death situations.
These same people are known to consume granulated coffee in copious amounts to chase away physical and mental fatigue. Since it is both readily available anywhere in the world and also legal, not to mention its low potential for toxicity and low abuse potential, caffeine is for soldiers and fitness enthusiasts alike, the go-to supplement to increase aggression and improve physical and mental performance.
Caffeine has been shown to be especially effective when doing monotonous or repetitive tasks. Training in the gym, whether it’s endless reps of squats or 20 minutes of HIIT requires an enormous amount of mental focus, physical intensity and attention to proper execution.
That’s why caffeine with its arsenal of potent ergogenic actions is very useful. Besides caffeine’s boosting effect on CNS activity, there is also the combined impact of caffeine’s metabolites theobromine, which improves nutrient and oxygen flow to your brain, theophylline which relaxes the muscles and improves heart rate efficiency and paraxanthine, which improves lipolysis, the process where fats are broken down to be used as an energy source.
Caffeine actually increases the levels of fatty acids in the bloodstream to a degree where carbohydrates deposits are preserved and utilized more efficiently. This, in turn, increases muscle endurance and aids in keeping high energy levels for longer. Mixing carbohydrates and caffeine in your pre-workout meal is a proven strategy for improving physical performance.
But, consuming this combination within four hours after training has been shown to increase athletic performance by increasing the glycogen uptake by approximately 65%. Caffeine prepares us for action and improves productivity, by increasing the neural firing and stimulating the pituitary gland to produce more adrenaline.

  
        
          
          
        
    


Put simply, it makes us move and act faster and more efficiently and also makes us stronger at the same time. It’s no wonder it’s a staple ingredient in every pre-workout supplement that’s proven its worth, not to mention it boosts muscle glycogen uptake when taken after training.
Not just a stimulant
When mixed together, water and caffeine are easily absorbed into the bloodstream and then rapidly transported through the blood-brain barrier to work their magic. When given caffeine, your brain releases its natural supply of stimulants and you get a cascade of potent psychoactive effects. Caffeine’s molecular structure is very similar to a molecule in the brain, known as adenosine.
When adenosine is located in its receptor areas, it makes you feel tired, which ensures that your body gets as much rest as it needs. But, since it’s similar to the molecule of adenosine, caffeine can also get inside the adenosine receptors.
Since adenosine molecules are not present, sometimes up to 5 hours, you won’t feel tired, but energized and alert instead. When it keeps the adenosine receptors occupied, caffeine increases the release and circulation of a multitude of stimulants found naturally in the brain, such as the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, adrenaline and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
The individual and combined effects of these compounds, when released in high amounts, control anxiety, decrease depression, increase your mood and motivation, fight off mental fatigue and increase the overall sense of well-being.
That’s why caffeine can be considered more as an enabler of stimulants than a stimulant itself. In either case, when used properly, this great supplement, can positively change your brain chemistry.
Should you consume it or not ?
The general conclusion is that when taken in proper doses and not abusing it, caffeine can greatly improve overall human body performance and better than any other stimulant.
Regardless of whether you’re striving to hit a new one rep max, trying to build as much muscle as possible, preparing for an endurance competition or trying to channel all of your mental energy into a creative project, caffeine, along with its numerous positive effects, should be a staple ingredient in everyday life.
If you keep the upper limit to 500mg daily taken in separate doses evenly spaced out, or taken at strategic times, like when getting 200 grams before training to prepare yourself prepared mentally and physically for the upcoming exertion, you will find that caffeine is the best performance-enhancing stimulant you ever find.

  
        
          
          
        
    


Taking into consideration that it only starts becoming toxic at approximately 150mg of bodyweight (for a person of an average weight of 80kg that would amount to 12g or 80 cups of coffee), caffeine has the lowest risk of causing any kind of health issues. And even better, it doesn’t require any prescription and it’s perfectly legal to buy.
However, as with any substance, it can cause addiction and brings a multitude of side effects including headaches, lethargy which could last 8-12 days after eliminating it from your diet. In order the get the most benefits, drink coffee early in the day and do not drink it 4-5 hours before going to bed.
You can also cycle it, for example, you can drink 1-2 cup a day and then increase the dosage to 5-6 over the next 5 days, to make it more effective. Caffeine is found in its most effective form in a good pre-workout supplement. These are excellent for taking your physical and mental performance to an entirely new level.
Simply put, caffeine can become your best training partner, and not just for training performance, it can help in all areas of life. Here’s how to use coffee to crush your workouts.

																									Does Coffee Help You Lose Weight ?
																								
											
																								
													To all people who are planning to lose weight and are doing that by reading tremendous amounts of conflicting advice about it on the Internet – it all might seem like rocket science at first.
They start losing their enthusiasm and wonder if it’s all worth it. While we can’t explain everything in one article, we can help about certain specifics regarding nutrition and supplements.

In this article we’ll explain the effects of coffee (or caffeine in coffee) on weight loss. Because there’s conflicting advice on this topic too, this article will serve as a detailed explanation of how caffeine can help you lose weight.
What is Caffeine?
Caffeine is a natural chemical stimulant found in various quantities in beans, leaves and the fruit of some plants. The way it functions as a stimulant is through the CNS (Central Nervous System) and its effects are increased alertness and energy, which is something many college students can confirm when they are preparing for university finals while drinking 5 double espressos a day.
Another effect commonly contributed to caffeine consumption is weight loss. If you take into consideration that caffeine stimulates the CNS, it would be safe to assume that it could also be helpful for weight loss.
Many long term studies have shown that consistent caffeine consumption is related to weight reduction and it seems that this has something to do with various factors that are based on the chemistry of the molecule of the caffeine itself.
Caffeine’s thermogenic effects
The level of caffeine reaches its peak after about an hour of consumption, which is the approximate time when people start feeling the initial stimulating effects.
It seems that caffeine is able to increase the expenditure of energy by around 10 percent in exercising individuals by increasing the body’s heat production. This so-called thermogenic characteristic of caffeine is believed to be one of the main reasons for the increased rate of energy expenditure on a daily basis.
 One of the studies has shown that drinking 600mg of caffeine results in an increased energy expenditure of around 150kcal per day. It’s important to note though that if you regularly drink coffee or are a frequent user of caffeine tablets as a supplement you will not experience the same thermogenic properties a first-time user would.
Metabolism of fat
Research has shown increased lipid oxidation after the consumption of caffeine. Even though it is an undisputed fact that caffeine is mobilizing fatty acids from the fat tissue, current studies have found little evidence to suggest that any enhancement in performance is because of fat oxidation. The fact that it is mobilizing fatty acids is a very important characteristic since it is believed it spares the muscle glycogen.

  
        
          
          
        
    


This basically means that you will still have your glycogen reserves intact and that the body will be able to use them in the latter part of the workout. By getting the fatty acids from the fat deposits, the body essentially uses the fats as an energy source instead of glycogen or the muscle tissue itself.
The way caffeine does this is through one extraordinary property; it actually stimulates the pancreas to release smaller amounts of insulin. You might wonder how it’s able to do so when it is neither a protein nor a carbohydrate and has no calories.
The reason it can do this is because caffeine has the ability to increase the production of adrenaline and glucagon, hormones that trigger the release of glycogen from the liver and get energy from fat deposits. This, in turn, raises blood sugar and insulin levels and decreases the cells’ sensitivity to insulin.
If we look at it closely we can deduce that the lowered sensitivity to insulin induced by caffeine is because of the increase of free fatty acids circulating in the blood, which the body now uses as an energy source.
The substance that causes the fat tissue breakdown is a metabolite of caffeine and it’s called paraxanthine. If you plan on targeting the stubborn fat specifically then you should focus on consuming caffeine before your training and it would have a greater effect if you drank it on an empty stomach.
One study has proven that consuming caffeine before your training can increase the fat burning potential by approximately 22% during the entire duration of your training.
What’s even more interesting is that several studies have proven that the fat burning effect can be prolonged beyond the training itself, also known as the afterburner effect. Since caffeine is a diuretic it is important to drink a lot of water.
Caffeine’s diuretic effects
With is stimulant properties, caffeine increases both your blood pressure and heart rate which results in an increased blood volume. All this blood has to be filtered by the kidneys which in turn results in increased waste production. This, of course, means that a lot of regular coffee drinkers go to the toilet a bit more frequently.
However, the acute diuretic effect is only visible when one has consumed more than 250mg of caffeine. This effect does not happen with smaller doses of caffeine usually found in single cups of tea or coffee.
Like any other stimulant as time goes by you will find caffeine’s effects diminishing due to the body becoming accustomed to it. Can the diuretic effect induced by caffeine be beneficial to fat loss?
Even though you might find that there has been a slight weight decrease on the scale, loss of water is generally never considered an effective weight loss.
