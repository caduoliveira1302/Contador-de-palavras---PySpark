"When you want to put on muscle or just increase your protein intake, one of your best choices would be to buy whey protein powder. However, even when picking your whey protein, you need to choose from a number of different types of protein powders.
These powders come in all kinds of flavors from tens of different brands, but there are two major types – whey protein isolate and whey protein concentrate. What’s the difference, you ask? Each type has its own pros and cons, so keep reading to figure out which one is the right one for you.
ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS THEY’RE MANUFACTURED?
Yes! Whey protein isolate is much better filtered than whey protein concentrate. As a matter of fact, to create whey protein isolate, the factories filter the concentrate over and over again until they achieve the desired purity.
This means that the particles in the isolate will be much smaller (by up to four times!) than the particles in the concentrate, which means that the isolate is much cleaner as a substance. This results in a larger degree of impurities in whey protein concentrate, which can lead to stomach problems and gassiness.
DO THEY HAVE THE SAME NUTRITIONAL VALUE?
No! Whey protein concentrate is not filtered like the isolate variant, which means that it still has anywhere from five to seven percent of milk fat in it. Don’t get discouraged, milk fat can be very beneficial for you because of its high percentage of anabolic growth factors, phosphor-lipids such as CLA and a multitude of other things. These substances can help you lose weight, keep your body safe against cancer and last but not least, keep you in the anabolic phase.
DO THEY TASTE THE SAME?
Nope! Whey protein isolate has a much clearer and better taste due to its superior filtration during manufacture. It has the taste of flavored milk, which is much better than the strong, powdered texture of a whey protein concentrate shake.
DO THEY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF PROTEIN ?
No! 100 grams of whey isolate contains higher amount of protein than 100 grams of whey protein concentrate. Again, this is because of the superior filtration process of the isolate variant, which means that more clean protein remained in the substance when it was being filtrated. The whey protein concentrate variants have a lot more fat and carbohydrates than the isolate, but the isolate will have much purer and a lot more protein per gram. This is the reason that the isolates are usually more expensive than the concentrates.
ARE THEY ABSORBED THE SAME?
No. Whey protein isolate is absorbed much faster than the concentrate variant and it will reach your muscles much faster as well. This means that the regeneration processes can start much faster and your workout will be more effective with isolates than with concentrates.
All in all, you get to make a personal choice when shopping for whey protein. Most people tend to like the isolate better because of its lower percentage of non-protein substances such as fats and carbohydrates, the virtually side-effect free composition and its superior taste, however you can choose as you like.
If you want to have the benefits of the extra amount of CLA in your shake, or if you’re on a smaller budget, a whey protein concentrate shake will get the job done.
Not as well as the isolate, but nevertheless, well enough. Also, if you aren’t very concerned about counting calories, a concentrate might be better for you anyway, but if you want cleaner and purer protein, you should pick the isolate variety.

"If you have a hard time deciding which protein powder to buy and struggling to choose between egg vs whey protein, worry no more. In this article we’ll guide you through all the benefits of egg and whey powders, which are the two most popular protein powders in the fitness and bodybuilding community.
When choosing the perfect protein supplement, there are a lot of factors to consider, first of all being your goal. Do you want to lose weight as quickly as possible or your focus is on muscle building? Maybe you just want to optimize your nutrition.
Either way, you will most probably have to spend some time experimenting with different types and brands of protein supplements before finding the one that best suits your goals and needs. 
EGG VS WHEY PROTEIN – THE BASICS
Both egg protein and whey protein contain all of the essential amino acids that are required for building and repair of all tissues. They are also very similar in terms of the overall protein content they offer, with 24 grams of protein per scoop for the egg protein powder and 20-30 grams of protein per scoop for the whey protein powder. The calorie counts of both protein powders are also close to each other and ranges between 120 and 130 for both types of protein powder.
The amount of carbohydrates and fats can vary from one brand to another, so it’s relatively easy to find a low-fat or a low-carb product from both types. However, egg protein derived from whole eggs can contain up to three times more cholesterol compared to whey protein.
HEALTH RISKS AND BENEFITS
If you’re lactose intolerant, you should opt for egg protein or whey protein isolate, that contain almost zero lactose. Other types of whey protein powder usually come in a less pure form and can be troublesome for lactose intolerant people. But for those who have no problem with dairy products, whey protein can also be a good source of calcium and help enhance bone and dental health.
Some studies have even shown that whey protein has the ability to lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels, and increase vasodilation (widening of blood vessels that results from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls), which is crucial to cardiovascular health.
BODYBUILDING GOALS
Whey protein takes the first prize in terms of both weight loss and muscle building. One recent study published in “Nutrition Journal” found that whey protein was more efficient at suppressing appetite than egg protein.
On the other hand, whey protein is also the better of the two when it comes to adding muscle mass, mainly because of its higher content of BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) which are vital for protein synthesis and muscle growth.
Unfortunately, egg protein hasn’t been studied as much as whey protein in the course of the past decade, so there’s a lack of scientific research that compares these two types of protein. However, some studies have shown that egg white protein has a slightly lower ability to stimulate protein synthesis compared to whey.
EGG VS WHEY PROTEIN – THE CONCLUSION
Since protein is the most discussed macronutrient in sports nutrition, it’s no wonder there are so many different types of protein powders available on the market. Even though whey protein seems to offer more benefits than egg protein, note that the latter is also a high quality source of all the essential amino acids the body needs, so don’t be afraid to give it a try and see what works better for you.

"By now it’s probably common to associate whey protein, in both name and reputation, with fitness, overall health, even with the development of muscles and their recovery, but there’s always that one question in the back of the minds of those that are looking for ways to lose a couple pounds, go down a size or gain some lean muscle – will adding whey protein to my diet be counter productive and make me gain weight?
Unfortunately, the short answer to that is yes, although it is not that simple. It’s the same as with any aspect of additions to a diet, where the body is not making use of that added fuel, or the balance of intake and exercise is off , basically too much of whey intake and not enough exercise could in turn result in more body fat. Sure, the genetic factor differs from person to person, but that’s the gist of it.
Most of you surely at this point have considered this article useless to them by now and are considering clicking off of it, but don’t stop reading yet because learning more about this invaluable part of your gym supplement collection is very important. Now, let’s take a look at what whey protein really is.
WHAT EXACTLY IS WHEY PROTEIN?
Whey protein is a protein that’s found in milk, along with another protein called casein, and when slowly digested is ideal for intense slogs and eating right before you go to sleep. It is created in the production of cheese, right from the liquid whey that’s left when curds come together. To make actual whey protein the remaining whey liquid needs to be processed and refined first to separate the proteins from the fats and lactose, and then dried to produce a type of powder.
The final result of whey protein in it’s regular powdered form is a blend of different various proteins including beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, serum albumin, lactoferrin and immunoglobulins – also known as antibodies. As we know, all proteins are made out of amino acids, which are often referred to as the building blocks to protein.
Whey protein is an all-rounder in fact as it’s low in lactose (which causes problems for many people) and is a complete protein that contains all 9 essential amino acids! That’s why it’s so good for building muscle – high amounts of branched chain amino acids are the ones responsible for the muscle protein synthesis.
With this we know what it is and how it’s used in our bodies when building some muscle is concerned, but what about in practice? Where does all that whey go when you’re working out regularly? 
DOES WHEY PROTEIN MAKE YOU GAIN WEIGHT ?
Or in other words – “does whey protein make you fat?”. This and similar questions are searched up and asked with any food item that you consume with regular exercise and otherwise.
For example – chicken is a highly searched up food with this exact question. Chicken being a healthy lean meat, that is low in the fats that you don’t want and high in protein like whey. Additionally, its great for building muscle and perfect for lean diets centered around losing weight. But, technically speaking, if you consumed too much chicken and that outweighs and outbalances your exercise regimen, you would gain weight from that.
By now it’s basically widely considered as a myth that whey protein will make you gain weight. It alone does not make you fat, and it’s actually a staple in many weight loss diets. Bouncing off the previous answer we gave to this question – yes, whey protein could possibly make you fat, but it’s all a matter of usage.
If it’s consumed in larger quantities without any exercise to balance the scales out, it could very much so contribute to weight gain. This is mainly because of the fact that whey is a quite the source of calories, in fact all macronutrients could potentially lead to weight gain when in excess.
While mostly fats and carbs are frequently the main usual suspects in this, protein is also a factor in your daily caloric intake. The human body only has a need for a certain amount of calories per day, as is suggested, and depending on your lifestyle and the level of your exercise that number may vary.
For example: people who are mass muscle gainers require a surplus of calories, for dieters and lean gainers there must be a balance between intake and exercise to avoid that surplus of calories.
However, there is another side to this argument – minus the scientific studies. The argument states that whey makes your body store more fat because of its effects on your level of insulin. It does this by practically raising your insulin levels, which are actually affected by the amount of energy you consume and the amount you burn off.
Now, if whey doesn’t actually make you gain weight, can it contribute to burning it?
THE OTHER BENEFITS OF WHEY PROTEIN
Whey protein has many beneficial properties other than the ones we already stated above. Whey can help you to increase your ability to burn fat when your body uses it as a source of protein right before exercise. This process is called beta-oxidation, it happens when the fatty acid molecules stored in your cells will begin to break down and produce acetyl-CoA, which is crucial for your body and it’s ability to metabolize.
Another benefit to it is that whey protein also plays a role in the process of thermogenesis, which is the body’s ability to convert calories into a type of heat energy. While you’re consuming whey protein, it leads to more calories being burned, which in turn makes you lose more weight by actually burning more calories for your body to use as an energy for muscle contractions.
The final benefit we’ll mention (even though there are many more), is that whey protein helps you to regulate your hunger by increasing the production of the hormone Cholecystokinin (CCK), which is a peptide hormone whose main purpose is to stimulate fat and protein digestion.

"Everyone who leads a fit lifestyle and cares about their health, understand how important protein is when it comes to achieving great physique goals. Countless studies have already shown how increased protein consumption leads to increased muscle gains, enhanced immunity and curbed appetite, making you feel full for longer periods, thus leading to reduced body fat levels.
And even though protein, especially whey protein, has proven itself to be very effective at helping people build better-looking bodies, new studies have started surfacing claiming that several of the building blocks of protein, branched chain amino acids (BCAA), can be even more useful than taking just whey protein.
Nutrition scientists have known about BCAAs’ many benefits and its effectiveness for many years, so there’s nothing new here. But, when they began a study to compare how effective consuming only BCAA vs whey protein for athletes, they got some pretty amazing results suggesting that BCAA are way more effective in comparison to whey protein when it comes to helping athletes reduce body fat levels, increase lean muscle mass and increase their strength.
Before you decide to dump your whey protein in the toilet, and buy BCAA instead, let’s examine the study more closely and see what fitness professionals themselves do to come up with the best way to use both BCAA and whey protein for maximal results.
BCAA VS WHEY PROTEIN
In order to properly understand the effectiveness of whey protein, we need to get a little scientific and look at the protein’s structure. Whey protein has a very high amount of specific amino acids, especially the following three: leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are collectively called branched chain amino acids or BCAAs.
When nutrition scientists began researching more about BCAAs, they concluded that they are actually quite effective on their own and athletes could use them to not only experience many of the same benefits whey protein provides but get some additional benefits beyond what consuming whey protein only provides at certain doses. Now, let’s examine the aforementioned study.
ARE BCAA MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WHEY PROTEIN?
In this specific study, the scientists monitored body fat percentage, lean muscle mass and strength of three separate groups of trained individuals that trained once a week for eight weeks total. The groups were divided as follows:
1. 10 people who took 28 grams of whey protein
2. 10 people who took 14 grams of BCAAs
3. 10 people who took 28 grams of carbs from a sports drink
Even though the results of the study did show that the group who took BCAA experienced the greatest amount of fat loss and increased their lean muscle and strength, it’s worth mentioning a few points here: 15 grams of BCAA is too much.
When the majority of BCAA supplements recommend around 5 grams of BCAA per serving, you’re looking at 3 servings of the majority of BCAA supplements. On the other hand, 30 grams of protein is approximately 1 protein serving. 30 grams of carbohydrates is also around 1 serving of an average sports drink.
This actually means that the study is comparing how effective is taking 3 servings of BCAA vs taking 1 serving of two other supplements, whey protein, and a sports drink. And considering that the majority of whey protein already have around 5 grams of protein per serving, if you took 3 whey protein servings you would also get around 15 grams of BCAAs and all other essential amino acids inside the whey protein which would most likely change the study’s outcome.
In the end, the study was made by a popular supplement company, which is a huge BCAA supplements manufacturer and it should come as no surprise that they would want the study’s results to show how incredibly potent BCAAs are.
THE CONCLUSION: BCAA VS WHEY PROTEIN – BOTH ARE AMAZING AND EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE
The study above actually shows that both BCAA and whey protein are very effective at helping individuals improve the composition of their bodies by increasing lean muscle mass, reducing body fat and make them stronger. The bottom line is that if you want to create a better-looking physique and lose fat in a safe and consistent manner over time, you should use both BCAAs and whey protein.
If you want to maximize their effectiveness, you should take the following into consideration: BCAA will give you the most bang for your buck, pre, intra, and post-workout when the body needs the amino acids as an energy source while training and to repair the damaged muscle tissue after training. Always choose products which have more than 3 grams of BCAAs per serving. It is also a general recommendation that you take 1 serving of BCAA pre-workout and 1 serving during workout.
Whey protein which already has high amount of BCAAs is great to be consumed pre and post-workout, but considering that even the purest, most filtered protein brands have around 100 calories in a serving, some people prefer that they save the protein for after the workout in the form of a protein shake or as a meal replacement. The general recommendation is that you take 1 serving of whey protein within the first hour post-workout and maybe adding another serving as a meal replacement or a snack during the day.
MAKING IT ALL WORK
Whey protein and BCAA are the two most effective supplements one can take to build more muscle, get leaner and recuperate faster. If you want to get maximal results, do the following on training days:
Half an hour before training take one serving of BCAAs mixed with 7-12 oz. of water, and you could also eat a light snack with carbs in it like some fruits, oatmeal etc. Next, during training, take one serving of BCAAs mixed with 7-12 oz. of water, and after your workout take one serving of whey protein, mixed with 7-12 oz. of your favorite drink.
The one-hour window after training is the perfect time to take carbs since it’ll help replenish the energy stores you burned and makes the protein more effective by getting it into the muscle cells more quickly. Go for 30-60 grams of carbs with your protein shakes to get maximal results. As a snack or a meal replacement you could take one serving of whey protein mixed with 7-12 oz of your favorite drink.

"As one of the best studied supplements in the world, whey protein packs an incredible nutritional value and plenty of health benefits.
In fact, whey protein is considered to be one of the top dietary sources of high quality protein available because it contains all nine essential amino acids – the most crucial nutrients for attaining your optimal level of fitness. It doesn’t matter whether you’re lifting heavy weights in order to get huge and ripped, trying to lose some excess weight or training light to improve the tone of your muscles and your overall health – whey protein can help you get where you want to be in less time.
Recent studies have shown that whey protein can help you increase size and strength and get rid of fat while preserving lean muscle mass.
One study from Baylor University has proven that consuming whey protein one hour before and one hour after the workout leads to the greatest mass and strength gains, while another group of researchers in Minnesota found that whey protein intake is associated to a significant loss of body fat.
And speaking about fat loss, what you probably don’t know is that whey protein can help you suppress your appetite and manage blood glucose levels.
One Canadian study concluded that consuming whey protein 30 minutes before a meal will decrease the amount of calories consumed and minimize the risk of overeating in subsequent meals.
But perhaps your chronically stressful lifestyle, a well-known obstacle on the path to a fitter and healthier body, prevents you from losing the desired amount of fat? As it turns out, whey protein can help you out with that one as well.
A recent study coming from the Netherlands suggests that whey protein consumption can help you significantly improve your mood, eliminate symptoms of depression and reverse immunosuppression by simultaneously reducing the levels of cortisol and increasing the production of serotonin.
Still, the greatest news concerning this potent form of protein come from a pool of new scientific data that dubs whey protein as one of the most promising tool in the global fight against certain forms of cancer, especially prostate and colon cancers.
 A study from the Ohio State University reveals that regular consumption of whey protein increases the levels of the cancer-blocking compound glutathione in the body.
Glutathione is made from the amino acid cysteine, a great amount of which is found in whey protein. It’s important to note that many scientific findings indicate that regular aerobic exercise is bad news for your glutathione levels leads, which in turn can negatively affect the health of your nervous, gastrointestinal and immune systems.
But a study from the University of Alberta found that whey protein supplementation is linked to a significantly lesser reduction in glutathione levels in subjects who engage in aerobic exercise.
As we mentioned above, regardless of your motives and goals, whey protein is an excellent way to speed up the effects of your training by stimulating muscle growth, increasing strength and contributing to greater fat loss, while also enhancing your health and well-being by reducing the risk of prostate and colon cancer, strengthening the immune system and promoting psychological balance and stability.
Science has spoken: including whey protein supplementation in your diet will make a significant difference in the way you live, eat and train, so make sure you choose a trusted, high quality brand and enjoy the beneficial effects of this amazing powder.

IT PRESERVES MUSCLE MASS AND REDUCES BODY FAT
Have you ever tried decreasing daily calorie consumption in the hopes you would lose the excess fat? One study which lasted for 12 weeks had its participants reduce their daily calorie consumption by around 500 calories. Afterward, they gave some of the subjects whey protein and to the rest, they gave an isocaloric mix beverage. The ones that took whey protein lost a much bigger amount of fat (around 6%) and preserved much more muscle mass. So, if you get the sudden urge to have a snack, go for a whey protein bar.
IT INCREASES MUSCLE STRENGTH AND SIZE
If you are in the gym training hard and heavy to get big and strong, whey protein is the perfect ally. A study was made where 20 men were put on a 10-week long workout program and one group were given 15 grams of casein and whey protein with 5 grams of BCAAs (Branched-Chained Amino Acids), while the rest took 20-grams of placebo. The ones who took the whey protein experienced a bigger increase in muscle strength and lean muscle mass. The study also found out that it is essential that you consume the whey protein an hour before working out and an hour after it.

IT DECREASES HUNGER
Whey protein has been shown to drastically decrease hunger, thus helping you avoid unnecessary fat accumulation. A study was made were 30 overweight men had to drink four different beverages. The ones that drank the beverage that had 50 grams of whey in it experienced a significant reduction of ghrelin levels, which is one of the hormones regulating hunger, lasting for 4 hours. So, instead of eating unhealthy snacks, consider drinking a whey protein shake.
IT FIGHTS CANCER
Cancer is a terrible illness that has affected millions throughout the world. Luckily, there are numerous ways to prevent it and protect yourself against it. The most widely used method is to regularly check for the specific kind of cancer that might run genetically in the family.

If you find yourself to be at risk, get checked immediately, follow the advice of your doctor and try to incorporate whey into your diet.
IT HELPS YOU COPE WITH STRESS
Stress is the number one reason why people often reach for alcohol or various drugs in order to cope with it. Numerous studies claim to have found a much better substitute for the people prone to being more stressed. One study, in particular, that was made on 60 subjects, put the same subjects through stressful situations and found that the ones who took whey protein had much fewer depression symptoms and seemed to be in a much better mood than the people who didn’t take it. They presumed that this was due to the changes in the serotonin levels in the brain. So, instead of drinking hard liquor, go for a tasty when protein smoothie or shake.
IT IMPROVES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
If you seek to improve the immune system, consuming whey protein would be the right choice. One study found that subjects that were doing a very hard aerobic activity had significantly decreased glutathione levels that are capable of affecting the gastrointestinal, nervous and immune systems.

"Whey protein is one of the most popular dietary supplements available today. From muscle growth and repair to increased energy and fat loss, this product can do wonders for your health. Numerous studies have found that whey protein may possess anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. When consumed regularly, it helps prevent diseases, reduces muscle loss, and speeds up recovery between workouts.
What Is Whey Protein?
A few years ago, whey protein supplements were only used by athletes and bodybuilders. Today, more and more people are realizing the amazing health benefits of whey protein. This natural compound is found in milk. It’s also available as a dietary supplement in the form of powder. Many stores offer protein bars, weight gainers, and meal replacements containing whey protein.
Unlike other types of protein, whey contains all the amino acids required for muscle protein synthesis. It’s one of the best natural sources of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). When combined with a clean diet and exercise, whey protein helps build lean muscle and aids in fat loss. This supplement is a great for dieters looking to shed pounds and preserve muscle.
Whey protein is derived from milk. When used as a dietary supplement, it can help you boost your daily protein intake without adding lots of carbs or fats to your diet. In general, whey protein powders contain less than five grams of carbs per serving and have little or no fat. These supplements are low in lactose. Depending on your goals, you can opt for whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, or hydrolyzed whey protein.  Next : Health Benefits Of Whey Protein

"If you take your protein supplement at the wrong time, chances are, you don’t get the full benefits of it, and a good part of the protein powder goes to waste. Here is a list of key points in time, when protein powder is needed the most, ranked in order of importance.
AFTER YOUR WORKOUT
Right after your workout your body needs raw materials to recover and rebuild itself. Consuming the right kind of nutrition after intense training will kick-start the muscle recovery process and put your body in a mode where it can produce muscle building hormones like testosterone, insulin, and growth hormone.
Taking 20-40 grams of protein along with high glycemic index carbs, immediately after the workout will make a drastic change in your physique over time. If you can afford only one protein shake a day this will be the best time to consume it. An hour to two after this protein shake is the time to eat real food (about 30-40 grams of protein and some low glycemic index carbs).
IN THE MORNING
When you wake up, your body needs food after the overnight fasting. This will be the right time for a whey protein shake or an amino acid supplement. Protein powder is assimilated faster than whole food and will get to your muscles faster. About an hour later it’s time for a real food breakfast and another 30-40 grams of protein.
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED
By consuming a “slow” digested protein like casein, you give your muscles a steady stream of “building blocks” trough the night.This is the way the muscles will stay in anabolic state during the longer fasting period. Remember, you don’t want to consume carbs before bed, because the body stores them as fat when there is no energy expenditure.
BETWEEN MEALS
Consuming protein between two meals helps your body to stay anabolic all day, especially if you have long periods of time in between meals. Because whey protein powder is easily digested, you won’t be full all the time and you will feel more hungry when the time for a meal comes.

"Looking to gain muscle and recover faster after working out? Then you should take protein supplements. From whey protein powder to soy protein and casein, there are hundreds of products available. Each type of protein has its own role. Some varieties are instantly absorbed into your body, while others take longer to digest. You will also find supplements containing a mix of fast absorbing and slow digesting protein.
With so many options available, it can be hard to tell what type of protein works best. Choosing the right supplements depends on your goals as well as on your diet and workout plan. Casein and whey protein are a staple in any bodybuilder’s menu. Whether you want to get bigger, lose weight, or gain strength, these products will bring you closer to your goals.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF WHEY ?
It’s important to understand how whey and casein protein work. Whey protein is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, so it makes a great post-workout meal. This product is digested in 90 minutes or less. The level of amino acids in your blood reaches its highest point between 90 and 120 minutes. For optimal results, have a whey protein shake before or after training. This muscle building supplement shouldn’t be used a night unless you work out late in the evening.
Whey has many benefits over other types of protein. Not only it digests quickly, but also contains branched-chain amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own. Additionally, it provides an ideal mix of readily available nutrients to replenish body fuel after intense training. Researchers have also found that whey stimulates protein synthesis and helps your muscles recover faster between workouts. Compared to casein, this product contains higher levels of leucine, which promotes muscle repair and prevents catabolism.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF CASEIN ?
Casein is best known for its anti-catabolic effects, slow digestion, and high amino acid content. This substance constitutes over 80 percent of milk protein. It’s slowly absorbed into the blood, offering a steady source of nutrients and amino acids. It also contains dairy calcium, which strengthens your bones and helps prevent osteoporosis. Due to its slow digestion time, casein is recommended at bedtime.
This slow digesting protein feeds your muscles while you sleep. After drinking a casein shake, you’ll reach a peak in blood amino acids in about four hours. This nutrient-packed beverage dramatically slows the rate of protein breakdown and supports muscle growth. The only downside is that it usually causes bloating and digestive discomfort in people with lactose intolerance.
WHEY VS CASEIN
So, depending on your needs (do you need a protein that absorbs faster or slower) and your tolerance to lactose, you can use one or the other type of protein as they both have their benefits. Many supplements contain both casein and whey to allow your muscles to grow and recover 24/7. The different absorption rates may increase protein synthesis and lead to greater gains.
Depending on your budget, you can either use a supplement containing both whey and casein, or use these two separately. Pay attention to your diet and make sure your protein shakes fit into your macros. Excess protein can lead to fat gain, so it’s important to watch your daily protein intake.
