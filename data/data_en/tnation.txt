0,"CASEIN PROTEIN BEATS WHEY, BUT WHICH CASEIN?
Casein protein is generally a better muscle builder, a better strength builder, and a better fat burner than whey.
PLAIN CASEIN
Most inexpensive casein protein powders are composed partially or totally of sodium or calcium caseinate, both of which the body absorbs fast like a bunny. As such, they cause a rapid rise of insulin. They also don't provide sustained levels of amino acids.
They're not a complete waste, but they're kind of anemic when it comes to doing the basic job of protein powders, which is building muscle.
UPGRADED CASEIN
If you want a casein-based, general use protein powder – one that does what's it supposed to do, i.e., bolster your daily protein intake for the purpose of muscle building – look for protein powder products that contain micellar casein. Micellar casein is composed of soap-bubble like molecules (micelles) that form a bolus in the stomach when consumed. That makes them digest really slowly.
It's really hard to make a protein powder from micellar casein – hence their relative rarity and higher price. You have to process it carefully and leave the milk proteins largely unmolested. Manufacturing micellar casein is almost like catching snowflakes in Maine and shipping them intact to California with a truck driver who stops outside a bar in the Mojave Desert to slam down a few tequilas.
It's worth the trouble, though, because micellar casein is the only protein that's been shown in lab studies to actually be anti-catabolic (Boire, 1997), meaning not only does it increase protein synthesis, it helps prevent muscle breakdown during and after intense exercise. Metabolic Drive® Protein contains an ample amount of micellar casein.

HOT-ROX FAQ
Answers to all your burning HOT-ROX questions!
T Nation April 11"
1,"THE ""BEST"" PROTEIN POWDER? NOT SO FAST!
What's the best protein powder? Well, the Men's Health website recently posted an article that listed what they thought were the 15 best protein powders to ""help you build muscle.""
Presumably, the two co-authors sampled the entire spectrum of powders in the protein universe and chose the ones they thought were the healthiest and most effective in building muscle. That, or they just went to Amazon and picked up a bunch of protein powders based on whether the label descriptions and ingredients appealed to their opinions or biases.
I suspect it's the latter. Anyhow, I don't know if their choices are backed by the editors of Men's Health, but there's a statement above the article that reads:
""Our product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site.""
I have no issue with them earning a commission through the links. That's the way the Internet market often works. However, I have issues with the ""expert-approved"" part of the disclaimer because their list is largely horse pucky.
Maybe that's too harsh. I'm sure they did their best, but they just prioritized the wrong things, and they clearly harbor a few common but erroneous assumptions about protein powders in general.
Let's address those erroneous assumptions so that you, the consumer, can truly pick the best protein powders for your needs, or at least avoid the products based on misconceptions.

2. Protein Powder from Plants

THIBAUDEAU'S SIMPLE FAT LOSS STRATEGIES
Ready to get lean but not ready to count every calorie? Here are three things you can start doing today.
Christian Thibaudeau August 10"
2,"The subject of collagen supplementation creates very little buzz in the lifting world, which is weird. Hell, it's the main component of connective tissue, which includes ligaments, tendons, and cartilage and accounts for roughly 25 to 30% of the protein mass in the human body.
If the connective tissue that provides the scaffolding for muscle is weak, you've got the equivalent of a house that wasn't built to code. As soon as an earthquake hits or a hurricane blows, down comes the house.
Let me spell it out for you. If the connective tissue is weak and you're lifting heavy, a tendon can blow, a ligament can rupture, cartilage can tear and fray, muscles can just give. At the very least, you ache an annoyingly large percentage of the time.
While it's begrudgingly accepted that adding collagen to your diet through food or supplementation is a terrific idea, few lifters, let alone athletes, do it.
I suppose the problem is that it's too witch-doctory a concept. Eating ground-up bones, tendons, and ligaments to improve the health of bones, tendons, and ligaments seems like eating the heart of a lion to gain its courage.
The difference? Ingesting collagen works, and it does so for a very simple reason. Collagen contains large amounts of amino acids, glycine in particular, that are often in short supply in humans and that are crucial to the production of collagen.
So in this case, the raw form of the very substance you're lacking is broken down in the digestive system and used to make the very same thing – collagen.
All of that's accepted science. However, there's another, little-known use for collagen, one that plays a huge role in not just structural integrity, but the actual way muscles develop and function.

3,"NUTRITIONAL EVOLUTION
People who want to build a lean, muscular physique go through a kind of nutritional evolution:
STAGE 1
First, they start to actually pay attention to nutrition. After the newbie gains fizzle out, they realize they need to improve their diet strategy... or, you know, actually have one.
They learn that things like protein and carbohydrates are pretty darn important for fueling workouts, recovering from workouts, and ultimately building the body they're after. They improve their food choices. Maybe they'll even pick up a bucket of whey protein at the grocery store.
Sadly, many folks stop right there. Then they assume they've reached their ""genetic limits"" and may even lose some of their enthusiasm for training. That's too bad, because there's one more step they could take.
STAGE 2
They could begin to fine-tune their protein and carb choices. They could learn how nutrient timing is important, and they could learn that different types of protein and carbs have different tactical effects on performance and body composition.
These lifters and athletes who enter stage two put on their lab coats and increase the magnification of their nutritional microscopes. They discover that specialized proteins and designer carbs exist, and these bespoke macros were created for the sole purpose of building muscle faster, protecting muscle, and making workouts more productive.
In short, they discover Mag-10®.
A NEW KIND OF PROTEIN
You've heard of the super protein, micellar casein, but there's another form of casein with its own unique set of benefits: casein hydrolysate. Unlike micellar caseins, hydrolysates are heavily processed... and that's a good thing.
The goal is to get a complex mixture of two and three amino acid (di- and tri-peptide) chains that have unique biochemical properties and that are absorbed intact, not requiring any further digestion.
Casein hydrolysates are at least 30% more effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis (read: gains, bro) than intact casein. These rapidly-absorbed casein hydrolysates are ideal for peri- or intra-workout consumption.
Casein hydrolysates also have another unique mode of action: they're more insulinogenic than whey proteins. ""Insulinogenic"" means they elicit a rise in insulin, which is exactly what you want in a protein during the peri-workout period because insulin shuttles amino acids to working muscles.
In short, a dose of a good casein hydrolysate, as found in Mag-10®, stimulates muscle protein synthesis to a much greater degree than a much larger dose of conventional proteins. And whole foods can't even come close.
A SPECIALIZED CARBOHYDRATE
Along with isomaltulose, Mag-10® contains just the right amount of cyclic dextrin, a nutrient-partitioning, functional carbohydrate. Cyclic dextrin:
Acts as a powerful anti-catabolic agent (controls cortisol).
Pulls fluids into muscle cells.
Potentiates glucose transport into muscle.
Delays fatigue so you can train harder, longer.
This special carbohydrate mixture, in addition to increasing metabolic rate, drives supraphysiologic levels of Mag-10®'s di- and tripeptides, as well as other vital nutrients, into the muscle cell.
FIVE WAYS TO USE MAG-10®
1. PROTEIN PULSING
How your body utilizes protein can have a powerful impact on how fast you gain muscle mass. Simply put, the greater the body's response to protein utilization, the greater the muscle gains achieved.
Unfortunately, the standard advice has been to ""consume a big dose of protein every couple of hours,"" which is too often and actually causes the body to become unresponsive to protein.
Science and experience now tell us that we actually should've been doing something called ""protein pulsing."" Protein pulsing is a science-based dosing strategy for making the body hyper-responsive to high-protein utilization and producing the maximum anabolic effect.
For protein pulsing to be effective, you have to achieve three or four sizable amino-acid ""spikes"" per day, and allow the body's amino-acid levels to return to baseline after each spike. In order to do that, you have to use a fast-acting protein formulation that's designed specifically for maximum pulsing effect.
Optimal times for pulses are 30 minutes prior to meals, between meals that are six hours apart (or longer), and post-workout, when the body is already in a hyper-responsive state and needs the additional protein. Mag-10® is the only formula in the world designed specifically to deliver the maximum pulse effect.
2. DURING CARDIO OR METCON
Many physique competitors use fasted cardio (doing cardio on an empty stomach first thing in the morning) for fat loss. The hope is that body fat is vulnerable in this state and can be better oxidized and burned.
But there's a problem. Two, in fact. First, the extra fat burning is minimal. Second, muscle is also vulnerable, and that means your metabolism is at risk.
If you like fasted cardio – because you've seen some benefits or it's just convenient for your schedule – you need a muscle protectant, something that blocks the catabolism of lean muscle mass but doesn't interfere with the possible fat-burning effects of metabolic conditioning. Mag-10® fits the bill perfectly.
Dr. Lonnie Lowery tested this in the lab and found that Mag-10®, when sipped during cardio, prevented any loss of muscle. He noted, ""Fat burning remained in high gear during aerobic sessions, while muscles were fully protected. This is a prime example of tactical nutrition.""
3. DURING A 24-HOUR FAST
Fasting, going for a period of time without food, has its benefits for fat loss and health, but it also has several drawbacks. Done in the traditional way, it may mess with your metabolic rate, or trigger overcompensation later in the day or week. And fasting certainly does nothing for muscle gains if taken to extremes.
The Biotest team spent eight years experimenting with different fasting protocols. We refused to put our stamp of approval on a plan unless it could provide not only a powerful thermogenic effect, but also a profound anabolic response. In other words, fat loss and muscle gain.
The versatile Mag-10® formula turned out to be the secret weapon. In short, we discovered that pulsing with Mag-10® several times a day instead of eating solid foods produced the thermo-anabolic effect we were after.
This one-day ""semi-fast"" triggered a greater rate of combined fat loss and muscle gain than when either are done separately, as with traditional ""bulking"" and ""cutting"" plans. Why? Because we're resetting the fat cell's hormone-release pattern to induce an anabolic metabolism that's fueled by the body's own fat stores.
We called this the ""Cheat Fast"" because it works even better if your 24-hour fast is preceded with a big meal the night before. The full plan can be found here: Faster Muscle Gains, Easier Fat Loss on Just One Day.
4. POST-WORKOUT
After a tough workout, the muscle-eating hormone cortisol is elevated and your body's rate of protein breakdown exceeds your rate of protein synthesis. Mag-10® squashes this catabolic effect and accelerates recovery and growth during this critical time period. This is especially beneficial for natural bodybuilders and athletes.
5. DURING FAT-LOSS DIETS OR LOWER-CARB DIETS
At only 127 calories per serving, Mag-10® provides an anabolic infusion of protein – 20 grams of protein that has the beneficial effects of nearly 100 grams of conventional proteins, without the added calories. This makes it perfect for any low-calorie diet, strict contest preparation, or a 5/2 eating strategy.
What's more, each serving of Mag-10® contains only 11 grams of carbohydrate – not that you'd even need to count the carbs in Mag-10®. Because of its unique nature, Mag-10®'s main carbohydrate source doesn't behave like a standard carb. It's practically impossible to gain body fat from it, yet you'll reap all the performance benefits of including carbs in your plan, like better workouts and much better recovery from those workouts.
THE PERFECT FUEL
Build more muscle. Lose more fat without sacrificing lean mass. Fuel and recover from your workouts. No matter your goal, Mag-10® will help you get there.

Hence this article. While the answers to all those questions will continue to evolve over time, here's what we currently know, or think we know, about protein and muscle.
1. How much protein do I need per training day to build muscle?
2. What's the optimal amount of protein to eat at each meal?

6,"Every so often a recipe comes along that becomes a staple. These sweet potato waffles did a pretty good job of that. Folks everywhere haven't had another breakfast since their discovery. This baked pancake promises to be another game changer.
CAKE, IN A PAN
In some cultures, they're called ""hotcakes."" In others, ""skillet cakes."" Whatever name you give them there's no denying their fluffy pancake texture, guilt-free great taste, and nutrient profile. Eat them for breakfast or dessert, or cut them up into snack-sized portions.
Many protein powder recipes can be rubbery and dry, but not these. You'll get one big fluffy pancake that'll serve one hungry person or two struggling hardgainers. The whole pancake packs a whopping 53 grams protein, coming from a mix of whey isolate, micellar casein, and eggs. That means a complete amino acid profile with varying degrees of time release.
You've got a few portions of fruit in there too, as well as over a third of your daily fiber intake in one sitting. This protein pancake will keep you fueled and keep your body running like clockwork.
INGREDIENTS
1 Medium ripe banana
1/2 Cup uncooked rolled oats or oat flour
2 Whole eggs
1 and 1/3 scoop (40g) vanilla Metabolic Drive® Protein
1/5 Cup (2.1 oz) zero-fat Greek yogurt
3/4 Teaspoon baking powder
1/2 Cup frozen berries
1 Heaped teaspoon pumpkin seeds (or any other seeds)
Few pinches salt
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat oven to 360 Fahrenheit or 180 Celsius.
Toss all the ingredients into a blender or food processor except the berries and seeds. Blend until well combined with no whole oats visible.
Spray an oven-proof skillet with a little low-calorie cooking spray. Pour the smooth batter into the skillet.
Throw some berries and seeds on top. You can use fresh berries, but frozen are just as good and keep the pancakes extra moist.
Bake on the top shelf for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Optional: Serve with a little extra Greek yogurt, honey, maple syrup, or sugar-free syrup.

BONUS: WHY PUMPKIN SEEDS?
The pumpkin seeds are a nice touch, especially if you're thinning a little on top. They contain beta-sitosterol which inhibits the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Multiple randomized controlled trials in both rats and humans have shown pumpkin seed oil to have antiandrogenic effects and help with male hair loss. For a healthy hormonal profile, pumpkin seeds are a great option.

7,"A segment of the population seems to be interested in protein powders derived from plants, specifically soy, peas, and even wheat. This makes sense if you're a vegan, are allergic to dairy, or your dad owns a legume farm and you get freebies, but otherwise, there's no real reason to switch from dairy proteins (whey and casein) to plant-based proteins.
Instinctively, some might also believe that plant proteins are somehow more healthful or nutritious than dairy proteins, but it's not true. Plant proteins are missing the vast majority of the vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that are intrinsic to the whole plant, although soy, specifically, contains just enough isoflavones to possibly cause problems.
(As I laid out in my article, Does Soy Protein Feminize You?, soy can actually exert estrogenic effects.)
Of course, dairy-based protein powders aren't exactly chockfull of vitamins and minerals, either, but in the case of whey, they at least contain immunoglobulins that can fortify human health.
But when it comes to the all-important issue of muscle protein synthesis, plant proteins don't pack on muscle the way dairy-based proteins do. Granted, not many studies have been done on the topic, but the general consensus is no, they don't – their biological value (BV) is just too low. BV is a measure of how efficiently the body utilizes protein.
While the Incredible Hulk is pea-green, it's unlikely that he got that way from pea protein, or for that matter, any other plant proteins. The results of a recent study on the anabolic effects of wheat protein, which is derived from turning gluten into free amino acids, seem to confirm this.

8,"Back in 1999, I got an email from someone who said he was a scientist that worked for Archer Daniels Midland, the giant global food-processing corporation whose mission it is to sprinkle the world knee deep in soybeans.
He wrote to tell me about how some of his research had shown that soy contained chemicals that acted like estrogen and could affect the reproductive systems of human males, thereby reducing sperm counts and reducing testosterone levels. As is commonly done by evil corporations everywhere, Archer Daniels Midland squelched the research.
Whether he really worked at the conglomerate and whether ADM really did suppress his research, I don't know, but regardless, he wasn't the first scientist to report that soy had negative effects on mammalian reproductive systems.
Prompted by his email, I wrote Bad Protein, probably one of the first mass market articles to talk about any possible adverse effects to men from eating soy. Since then, as you'd expect, the bodybuilding subculture, along with bio-hackers, nutritional chemists, and enlightened nutritionists, have long debated the health effects of soy, especially soy protein.
Most of the former are at least suspicious, if not downright terrified, of soy, while most of the lay public, thanks in large part to the marketing strength of ADM and other companies in the soybean business, continues to regard all-things-soy as synonymous with health.
But it's been almost 20 years since I wrote that groundbreaking article and a lot of the people who used to condemn soy have forgotten what it was about the grain that got everyone so lathered up in the first place. In fact, most modern-day articles don't even mention the possibility of an association between soy and male reproductive health.
So is soy still ""bad protein""? It's time to take another look at it and see if it deserves a second chance.

Just as an example, whey and sodium or calcium caseinate are very much different from micellar casein. You wouldn't ideally use the whey or the sodium or calcium caseinate as bedtime, grow-muscle-while-I'm-sleeping proteins.
The whey, sodium caseinate, or calcium caseinate wouldn't be a complete waste of money by any means, but they're not the right tools for this particular job. It'd be kind of like using a toilet brush to clean your choppers; you'd clean the front teeth well enough, but your canines, pre-molars, and molars would go unbrushed and turn a nice, mossy green.

10,"At first glance, protein powder from grass-fed cows sounds like a great idea. It's bound to be healthy, right? Sure, more essential fatty acids, no antibiotics, and no bovine growth hormones to make weird tumors sprout from your body. And forget about sprinkling it around the floorboards to kill vermin because it's also pesticide free.
But getting all jazzed up about grass-fed or organic protein powders is like getting jazzed up about an astronomically priced new toaster made by Elon Musk of Tesla because it's electric. You bring it home feeling all high-techy but your 8-year-old shoots you down by asking, ""But aren't all toasters electric, Dad?""
Yeah, they are, Junior, and by the same token, virtually all legitimate, quality protein powders are antibiotic free and pesticide free, just like grass-fed, organic varieties. And the alleged abundance of essential fatty acids and lack of bovine growth hormones found in grass-fed protein powders? They're also a non-issue.

12,"STIMULATE MUSCLE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS
Every bro that hits the gym asks this question, but what they really mean is, ""How much protein should I eat to maximize muscle gain?""
What lifters want is to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. In a post-training state, muscle protein synthesis is elevated and the cells are primed for the uptake of amino acids. At this point the stage will be set for gains.
So how much protein should you eat each day to maximize muscle growth? First off, eating excess protein beyond what's needed to maximize muscle protein synthesis does not accelerate muscle growth. The bro that's telling you to ""just eat a ton of protein"" isn't completely wrong, but he's not completely right either.
What science has shown us is that excess calories from protein don't easily get stored as body fat, but they also don't increase the rate of muscle growth. There's no way to accelerate muscle gains faster than what your genetics will allow unless you put your body in an enhanced anabolic state with steroid use.
You can't force-feed muscle growth via excess protein. If your weight training sessions are causing an adaptation response, and you're in a calorie surplus overall (somewhere between bodyweight x 16-20 calories), and your protein intake is adequate, then you're going to be growing as fast as you can grow.
There are no shortcuts here, but there are some optimal ways to use protein intake to maximize what mom and pop gave you:
A gram of protein per pound of bodyweight per day will cover just about everyone, regardless of age or experience, unless you're kids-point-at-you-at-the-store fat.
Around 40 grams of whey protein post-training will maximize muscle protein synthesis.
A slow digesting protein containing casein before bed is a good idea to keep muscle protein synthesis elevated throughout the night.
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN A DAY?
Three squares of approximately 30-40 grams of protein at each meal. A post-training shake of 40 grams of protein. Then 20-40 grams of casein before you hit the sack. If you're eating in a calorie surplus, and that surplus contains carbs – as it should – then there will be a little protein that comes along with those carb sources. Those count too.
Getting enough protein often isn't the issue for most guys who aren't growing. It's often a lack of overall calories and training intensity that's holding them back. Once all of those things are in place... boom. Gainz.

THE DAVE TATE PROJECT - PART 1
When Dave Tate needed nutrition help, he turned to Dr. John Berardi. Here’s what he learned.
John Berardi, PhD March 14"
13,"Someday relatively soon we'll be consuming protein powder made from insects. I know you're making a scrunched-up little disgusted-Yoda face right now, but everything points to this eventuality.
PROTEIN POWDERS: BEHIND THE SCENES
Current proteins derived from dairy are hugely expensive and the price is ever escalating. Caseins and wheys cost protein companies upwards of 6 dollars a pound, which is about 500 to 600 percent more than what they cost in the 90's. And that's just the basic stuff. Very high-quality proteins can cost as much as 20 dollars a pound.
Then, on top of that, companies have to make a profit, and they determine a price point that rewards the store that sells it, the middlemen that got it into the store, and of course, themselves.
Oftentimes, to cut costs, disreputable companies ""spike"" their protein with keratin from hair, feathers, fur, and who knows what else. (Now you can make your scrunched-up Yoda face.) It all registers as protein, but by no means does it contain all the amino acids you need to grow muscle (or any other tissue). However, it lets these scoundrels shave a few dollars off their production costs.
Costs will likely continue to rise, though. That's why companies, reputable and disreputable alike, will eventually have to consider a less expensive alternative to casein and whey.
ENTER INSECT PROTEIN
Aside from their exoskeletons, which are made of indigestible chitin, insects are nothing but protein and unsaturated fats. Even that indigestible chitin is potentially useful as it makes each insect a bite-sized combination of protein and Metamucil.
Insects are cold-blooded, so they're really efficient at converting feed into protein. Consider crickets. They need 12 times less feed than cattle, 4 times less than sheep, and only half as much as chickens and pigs. And they (with the exception of cockroaches, termites, and a few others) do it without producing greenhouse gases.
Think of how easy it would be to mass-produce insects for consumption or conversion into protein powders. You don't need to clear land, you don't need a lot of feed, and many can live off of organic waste. In other words, if you poop, you're halfway there to becoming an insect farmer who sells his mini-livestock to insect processing plants! Keep them dogies movin', cowboy, or should I say, bugboy?
Just think, you could have a crowd of cockroaches, a muster of meal worms, a litter of louse, a drove of dung beetles, or a pack of pillbugs. All of these are edible insects that are eaten somewhere around the world, as are ants, bees, dragonflies, grasshoppers, grubs, midge flies, walking sticks, water bugs, and waxworms. Some, like bees, allegedly taste like ""mushroomy bacon,"" while some of the larger versions of cockroach are said to taste like greasy chicken.
It doesn't matter, though, a theoretical insect protein powder would look and taste totally benign, probably flavored the same way current protein powders are. Protein companies would even wage advertising wars, claiming that their grub protein powder has a better PER (protein efficiency ratio) than waxworm protein powder.
Sure it sounds repugnant, but all food like and dislikes are cultural; you eat what you grew up eating. Things like Jell-O (from boiled down animal parts), hot dogs (do I even need to detail their ingredients?) and even dairy products, things we take for granted in the Western World, are disgusting to various cultures.
But we'll get there. Consider that Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, now sells toasted grasshoppers inside the park, right next to the brats, dogs, burgers, and Cracker Jacks, and they sold out of them this past opening day.
Besides, some of those spiked protein powders from China? They're probably loaded with bug protein already. You just don't know it.

INGREDIENTS
3 bananas, sliced and frozen
2 cups almond milk (or milk of choice)
4 scoops Metabolic Drive® Vanilla (120g)
1/4 cup dark chocolate chips, organic
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS
Slice bananas and freeze them. Speckled bananas work best.
Add frozen bananas and all other ingredients to a blender or food processor.
Blend until smooth or leave slightly chunky for texture.
Pour into a container and freeze. Should be ready to eat in a couple of hours.
Now, you don't have to freeze the bananas first. That can make the mixture harder to blend if you don't have a great blender or food processor. It'll just take a little longer to freeze into ice cream.
Option: Replace the vanilla protein with strawberry Metabolic Drive® Protein. Leave out the chocolate chips and toss in a few fresh or frozen strawberries. Boom... strawberry-banana ice cream.
Note: Not all protein powders are created equal. If you use other brands, you'll get different results. This recipe was made using a gourmet whey/casein blend, Metabolic Drive® Protein, which has been specially designed to work as a shake and in recipes.

INGREDIENTS
1 Cup old-fashioned oats
1 Cup unsweetened apple sauce
2 Scoops (60g) vanilla Metabolic Drive® Protein
1 Teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 Cup Splenda (or equivalent sweetener of choice)
1/2 Teaspoon baking powder
As much cinnamon and powdered ginger as you'd like
Pinch of salt
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl (because without a bowl this would be very messy).
Using a cookie scooper, medium ice cream scoop, or just a spoon, place 5-8 mounds of dough onto the sheet pan.
Bake for around 18-22 minutes. If you stick your finger in one and it feels too soft to pick up, it's not ready yet. If it looks like a charcoal briquette, it was ready an hour ago and you need adult supervision in the kitchen.
CALORIES & MACROS
The whole batch contains:
660 calories
52g protein
90g carbs
8g fat
We could break that into smaller sizes, but we both know you're going to eat them all in one sitting. If not, you can handle the basic division.
NOTE
This recipe was tested with a premium protein blend – Metabolic Drive® Protein. If you use a discount whey-only powder that you bought at a store that also sells tampons, then don't expect deliciousness.

17,"WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIGHER-PROTEIN DIETS
Based on a bevy of studies we've covered previously on T Nation, here's what we know:
A fat-loss diet that's higher in protein leads to more fat loss and more muscle preservation than a diet lower in protein... even if overall calories are the same in both diet plans.
A diet higher in protein leads to more muscle gain than a diet lower in protein... again, even if calories are kept the same.
A diet higher in protein leads to less belly fat than a lower-protein plan. You guessed it... even if calories are the same in both diets.
Protein is the most satiating (filling) of the three macronutrients. So a high protein fat-loss plan will make you less crazy than a low-protein diet plan.
It's very difficult for your body to convert protein into body fat, even at very high amounts. If a larger chunk of your diet is made up of protein, you'll be able to eat more and still lose fat.
Increasing protein intake above the usual recommended levels enhances protein synthesis, lean body mass, postprandial thermogenesis, and cardiometabolic health.
All very cool. But is there a difference between whole-food protein sources and protein powders? Science has taken a look.

THE PALEO HYBRID DIET
A “paleo” foundation plus some starchy foods and workout nutrition. Is this the most effective approach a lifter can follow?
Nate Miyaki January 14"
18,"Traditional muscle science – the kind studied by pasty-faced guys in lab coats – has long insisted that 20 to 25 grams of post-workout protein is the amount you need to cause maximum stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (basically muscle growth). Their assumption was that it was pretty much a waste of good protein to exceed that amount.
New research seems to shove that assertion in their face. A paper printed in the August 4th edition of the journal, Physiological Reports, describes a study where weight-trained males were given either 20 or 40 grams of whey protein after a bout of whole-body resistance exercise.
The group that ingested 40 grams had a significantly higher muscle protein synthesis than the group that ingested 20 grams. Furthermore, the effect was equally significant, regardless of the amount of lean body mass (LBM) in the test subjects. (There were two groups of test subjects, one with ""lower"" LBM and one with ""higher"" LBM.)

One thing that remains unanswered, though, is what effect ingesting amounts larger than 40 grams has on weight-trained subjects. Based on the observations of many in the strength game, the amount of protein you can take before hitting the ceiling of muscle protein synthesis seems to be much higher than 40 grams and has a lot to do with the leucine content of the protein source.
Take-home message? You're not wasting protein consuming 40 grams after training. The old ""20 grams"" recommendation can safely be doubled. And you can probably go higher than that.

5 FAT LOSS STRATEGIES THAT AREN'T STUPID
Pick one or two of these strategies and lean up for good.
TJ Kuster April 7"
19,"Everyone has an opinion about protein, and the myths surrounding it are rampant. That's why sorting the facts from the crap will lead to better choices regarding your own diet and protein intake. Answer the questions below and see if you've been falling for the myths.
FACT OR MYTH?
THE RDA (RECOMMENDED DIETARY ALLOWANCE) PROTEIN SUGGESTIONS ARE JUST FINE FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK OUT.
Hint: The RDA guideline for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of bodyweight per day. So if you weigh 190 pounds (86 kilograms) you'd need about 69 grams of protein.
The Answer: Lifters and athletes concerned with their performance or physique require more protein than what's recommended by the RDA. So it's a myth (and a joke) that the RDA protein recommendations are adequate for ass-kicking individuals.
Here's Why: RDA protein recommendations are too low for certain groups. Those recommendations were never intended for people attempting to enhance performance, maintain, or gain muscle. In fact, a higher protein intake may have positive benefits regarding different health ailments including obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease and muscle wasting.
The RDA guideline reflects the minimum daily needs of protein required to maintain short-term nitrogen balance in healthy, moderately active people. Nitrogen balance compares the amount of nitrogen coming into the body (from dietary protein) to the amount being lost. It's often used as a measurement of protein balance since protein is 16 percent nitrogen.
If you're consuming the same amount of nitrogen that you're losing, you're in nitrogen balance. If you're consuming more than you're losing, you're in positive nitrogen balance. If you're losing more than you're consuming, you're in negative nitrogen balance and are losing protein.
Nitrogen balance studies often involve examining urinary nitrogen levels. Approximately 90 percent of the nitrogen in urine is urea and ammonia salts – the end products of protein metabolism. The remaining nitrogen is accounted for by other nitrogen-containing compounds.
This nitrogen balance method is useful, but it has problems: Urine collections tend to underestimate nitrogen losses, dietary intake tends to be overestimated, miscellaneous skin and hair losses are prone to error, and the response to increased protein intake varies tremendously.
THE REALLY GEEKY STUFF
In a review published in the International Journal of Sports Nutrition, researchers concluded, ""Those involved in strength training might need to consume as much as 1.6 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram per day (approximately twice the current RDA) while those undergoing endurance training might need about 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram per day (approximately 1.5 times the current RDA).""
In another article published in Nutrition & Metabolism, researcher Donald Layman argued that the dietary guidelines should be improved and reflect new understandings about protein requirements. According to him, ""During the past decade a growing body of research reveals that dietary protein intakes above the RDA are beneficial in maintaining muscle function and mobility."" Diets with increased protein have been shown to improve adult health when it comes to treatment or prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease and muscle wasting.
A review published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary protein on body composition in energy-restricted resistance-trained athletes, and to provide protein recommendations for these athletes.
The researchers concluded that ""...the range of 2.3 to 3.1 grams per kilogram of FFM (fat free mass) is the most consistently protective intake against losses of lean tissue."" In other words, for every kilogram on your body that's not fat, you should be consuming 2-3 grams of protein in order to preserve lean tissue. So if you have 190 pounds of lean tissue, up to 258 grams of protein would be optimal for you.
In addition, the goal of the athlete should be considered. Leaner athletes or those having a primary goal of maintaining maximal FFM should aim toward intakes approaching the higher end of this range. Even higher levels of protein than those recommended in the review are not uncommon in exercising individuals. It's unlikely that negative health consequences will follow from higher levels of intake, assuming there are no related health problems that would suggest limiting intake.
FACT OR MYTH?
THE THERMIC EFFECT OF PROTEIN IS THE SAME AS IT IS FOR CARBS AND FAT.
Hint: The thermic effect of feeding or diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) is the amount of energy your body has to expend in order to digest and assimilate food. So picture a lean chicken breast (mostly protein), a bowl of rice (mostly carb), and tablespoon of butter (mostly fat). Which do you think your body will have to work hardest to digest?
The Answer: Among the three macronutrients, protein ranks highest in diet induced thermogenesis. So it's a myth that they're all equal in terms of their thermic effect. That means it'll cost you more calories to digest and absorb protein than it would fat and carbohydrate.
Here's Why: The consumption of protein requires an expenditure of 20-30% of the calories derived from protein. So, if 200 calories of protein are eaten, 40-60 calories are burned during digestion. DIT from carbohydrate is 15-20% and 2-5% for fat.

FACT OR MYTH?
PROTEIN IS MORE SATIATING (FILLING) THAN FAT OR CARBOHYDRATE.
Hints: Protein has an influence on CCK (cholecystokinin) and ghrelin. Protein may stimulate cholecystokinin (CCK) and decrease ghrelin. CCK is secreted mostly from the inner layer of the gastrointestinal tract has been shown to act as a satiety signal. The satiating effect of CCK was first demonstrated when administering CCK to rats. It ""dose dependently"" reduced meal size. Ghrelin is produced primarily in the stomach and has appetite increasing properties. Ghrelin levels are relatively high prior to a meal and they decrease after a meal.
The Answer: It's a fact that protein is usually more satiating than fat or carbs. When comparing protein, fat, and carbohydrate, protein is generally reported as the most satiating (satisfying to a point of full or beyond) and fat as the least satiating.
Here's Why: Research indicates that one of the primary factors involved with the satiating effects of protein is the thermic effect of feeding, mentioned above. Though protein's influence on ghrelin and CCK may play a large role in its satiating effects, more research needs to be conducted in these areas, as findings have been indecisive. Future research should concentrate on different levels of protein, different types of protein, and consumption of proteins in short and long term.
THE REALLY GEEKY STUFF
A review published in Nutrition & Metabolism reported that protein induced thermogenesis has an important effect on satiety. ""Protein plays a key role in body weight regulation through satiety related to diet-induced thermogenesis.""
A study published in Physiology & Behavior investigated the relative satiating effect of the macronutrients in lean women. On four separate occasions, the composition of an iso-caloric lunch ""preload"" was controlled in 12 lean women. Macronutrient composition had a significant effect on short-term hunger – the women were less hungry after the protein preload compared to the preloads with the other macronutrients. They also ate less after the protein preload.
A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition tested the prediction that increasing protein while maintaining the carb content of a diet lowers body weight due to decreased appetite and decreased calorie intake. The study showed when increasing the protein intake from 15% of diet to 30% of diet (while eating the same amount of carbs) there was a decrease in appetite and fewer calories were consumed.
The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism published a study that compared the effect of different proteins and carbohydrates on indicators of appetite and appetite regulatory hormones. CCK level was one of the primary outcomes measured.
Calorie intake was higher after the glucose preload compared with lactose and protein preloads. CCK level was higher 90 minutes after the protein preloads compared with glucose and lactose level. Researchers concluded that ""acute appetite and energy intake are equally reduced after consumption of lactose, casein, or whey compared with glucose.""
ONE QUICK CAVEAT
The research sometimes gets a little messy. For example, some studies are indecisive when it comes to protein intake and ghrelin levels. This is why you need to rely on your own reasoning, logic, and experience while gathering info from the research.
