What Are The Different Types Of Whey?
Have you ever walked through the milk or protein powder aisle? 
You might have felt overwhelmed with all the different kinds of whey available on the market. Or even by the different kinds of protein powder…
Well I’m here to break down all the different types of whey out there.  I want to make it easier for you to understand the differences. So, you can make an informed choice when including whey protein into your diet. 
Hopefully you will leave understanding the different types. But also, that you have a short but strong basis on the benefits of consuming grass fed and cold filter processed whey over the standard industrial whey proteins.
 
What can be found on the protein market?
 
Animal Protein:  When the protein from milk is broken down, you get the watery-by product of the milk manufacturing process. Composed of two kinds of protein:
Although both are considered high quality as they contain all amino acids, whey is considered particularly more beneficial in increasing the production of new protein in your muscles.
Plant-based protein: on the market, are vegetable protein powders such as pea or rice. However, we will not dive into those as they have a lower amino acid profile and are harder for the body to absorb.
 


The different kinds of whey
 
There are currently 3 different kinds of whey protein powder on the market: isolate, concentrate and hydrolysate. Each one is processed differently and their nutritional content varies. Concentrate and isolate tend to be the most popular on the market. All come, however, with their advantages and disadvantages.
 
A) Whey Isolate 
Once processed, whey is usually broken down into two forms: (Smithers, 2008)
Isolate undergoes additional processing and purification. It minimises extraneous carbohydrate and fats. In order to maximise the protein content. It results that, isolate has a higher protein content than concentrate.
 However, it contains less naturally occurring benefits in terms of macro- and micro-nutrients. Indeed, they are destroyed in the last process.
 
B) Whey hydrolysate 
Whey protein hydrolysate can either be a concentrate or isolate. Nonetheless some of the amino bonds have been broken by exposure of the proteins to heat, acids or enzymes.
The advantage is that it is more quickly absorbed in the stomach. Indeed, you get the quickest protein absorption due to the hydrolyzation, which almost acts as a pre-digestion process. This generally means faster recovery rate for your muscles.
However, hydrolysate generally doesn’t contain all the naturally occurring benefits that concentrate may offer. Especially if whey concentrate is cold filtration processed and grass-fed. Besides, despite its high price, hydrolysate generally tastes bad.
 
C) Whey concentrate 
It is generally cheaper and easier to find as it is quite popular for some good reasons!
As it goes through less processes, relatively to others protein powders, concentrate is the healthier. Indeed, it contains the naturally occurring macro- and micro-nutrients derived from the manufacturing process. It is also the most calorie dense form of supplement. Isolate whey may have higher protein percentage, concentrate is healthier. Because, it has nutritional benefits that go beyond better muscle recovery.
 
D) The cold filtration processed and grass-fed whey concentrate
This form of concentrate is really hard to find and serves as a reference in terms of nutritional profile. Indeed, if grass fed and cold pressed, whey concentrate can be especially healthy.
Heat can often kill all the micronutrients (ie. the powerful antioxidants) and be more damaging to the proteins hence cold pressed whey is ideal.
Additionally, it’s easy to assume that most cows eat a grass-fed diet. However, that is not the case – most cows are fed a grain rich diet (generally with fertilizers and GMO) and are given antibiotics to grow faster and bigger. This unfortunately affects the quality! Whereas grass-fed farming is more sustainable and generally more ethical. This method ensure that the cows produce a better whey in terms of quality, nutrient profile and taste
Protelicious is just that – cold filtration processed and grass-fed whey concentrate that has nothing to hide and goes above and beyond simply helping in muscle recovery and tasting good.
 


Conclusion
 
Protein market has a lot to offer. However, as it is about your nutrition, it’s vital to know what you are doing. Reminder that animal protein has the most complete amino acids profile. Then that whey is generally more nutritive than casein. Finally, master the difference between the 3 kinds. Isolate contains more protein, hydrolysate is the quickest absorbable and Concentrate is the healthier. Notice that cold filtered process and grass-fed whey concentrate is definitely the optimal for overall health. 
Hopefully this helped clarify between the different kinds of whey in regard to price, digestibility, taste, absorption and richness in nutrients!

Lab to Life Series: 6 Signs of Protein Deficiency
You might be concerned with the amount of quantity of protein you consume. Chances are, although you might be eating the right amounts, you might fall short in terms of your quality and frequency. The body needs daily absorbable, high quality and complete protein. This blog will explain 6 signs of protein deficiency that might surprise you!
You may have read our blog on the importance of protein … The first article in this Lab-to-Life series on protein started with the fundamentals, “Lab-to-Life Series: 5 Little Knows Facts About Protein & It’s Functions”. In this interview of our Chief Science Officer Dr Jean-Francois Lesgards (PhD: Chemistry/biochemistry and researcher for CNRS) by Sheila Partrat, we will explore 6 signs of protein deficiency.
 
Sheila asks:
Jean-Francois, in the first post we looked at our daily protein requirements, and how we often fall short.How can we tell that we are not getting enough protein?
Jean-Francois replies:
Firstly as a refresher, we can store fats and carbohydrates that are used for energy in the form of fats (triglycerides) or glycogen (for glucose), but we can’t store amino acids, which are the building blocks of the body.That’s why we need to replenish our protein supply daily.Protein deficiency can manifest in many ways, which are not always easy to identify.
Jean-Francois continues…
Here are a few signs to be aware of:
 

 1. Lowered Immune System:  
Most of us know that good nutrition; in addition to sleep and good hygiene is key in maintaining immunity. Quality protein however is not always high on the list, which it should be. High-quality protein, rich in essential amino acids (EAAs), particularly in sulfur amino acids (cysteine, methionine) will boost our immune system as well as our anti-inflammatory defenses.
 
2. Wounds take longer to heal:
Slow wound healing: Protein aids the body in repairing damaged tissues. When we don’t get enough protein, we have a difficult time forming collagen, necessary in the healing process.
 
3. Poor Sleep:
There are many factors that negatively impact the quality of sleep; one of the possible causes is unstable blood sugar levels and a decrease in serotonin production. Blood sugar swings during the day carry over through the night. Eating foods with quality protein before bed can help stabilize blood sugar. It can also contribute to the tryptophan and serotonin production that encourages quality sleep.
 
4. Prone to Injury:
A diet that is low in protein can raise the risk for muscle loss, slow bone healing, and increase bone weakness, fractures, and even osteoporosis. Protein is key for calcium absorption and helps with bone and muscle metabolism. It’s even more of an issue when we age. A diet high in amino acids can help treat muscle loss due to aging (sarcopenia).
 
5. Poor Concentration:
Protein is needed to support many aspects of healthy neurological and hormonal functioning. Poor concentration can be a sign that there is a deficiency in the neurotransmitters you needed to focus including dopamine, adrenalin, noradrenalin, and serotonin. Neurotransmitters are synthesized using amino acids. Certain Amino acids also increased magnesium uptake in cells contributing to the relief of stress.
 
6. Blood Sugar Fluctuation:
An adequate supply of protein helps to regulate blood sugar and prevent cardiovascular diseases. Studies show that whey protein can be used in medical/nutritional therapy to regulate blood sugar (hyperglycemia). It can also lower triglycerides, reduce blood pressure, and the risk of hypertension, and consolidate arterial health. 
Sheila asks:
Where do does our body get the amino acids necessary if we don’t get them through food
Jean-Francois replies:
It’s quite simple. If the foods we eat provide too few amino acids, especially essential amino acids, (see BP#3 on quality protein), our body breaks down protein-rich tissues – our muscles, for example, in order to access them. Therefore, the initial effect of low protein intake can result in muscle wasting accompanied by increasing weakness.
Thanks Jean- Francois. It’s clear. Adequate protein is essential to health. The quality of protein is also important.
 

Solutions:
If you are experiencing one or more of these signs there is a possibility you are not getting enough good quality, absorbable protein in your diet on a daily basis.It may be time to re-evaluate what you are eating on a daily basis to determine if you are getting enough protein. Check out our blog on what distinguishes quality protein and where to find it.
Our bodies are amazing machines and if you give it what it needs it will function optimally without supplementation.

How Much Protein Should I Consume?
The debate has gone on for a while now: how much protein should I consume? 1g per kilogram of bodyweight? 1.5g per kilogram of body weight? Twice these amounts? 
Consensus on an appropriate quantity of protein seems hard to find, let alone consensus on which system of measurement to use; imperial or metric?
So here’s a different approach: what is the minimum effective dose?
 
 
What is the research saying?
 
Let’s work backwards. Given protein’s role in muscle building and maintenance, the minimum dose is that which allows people to maintain muscle mass. However, the importance of consuming enough protein intake goes beyond simply maintaining muscle mass. If you consume enough high quality protein, daily, you will also help support hormonal processes, strengthen the immune system and the list goes on.
 
 
So, how much should I consume?
 
Generally speaking, one should aim for 1g of protein per kg of body weight.
  
However, for those that are elders or have absorbability issues, you should aim for 1.5g per kg of body weight. Campbell et al ran a great study analysing the effects of the RDI on elderly populations (around 1g per kg of body weight) and found that over 14 weeks, their participants lost more muscle mass than normal.
 
However, just consuming enough protein is only half the battle. It is very important to also pay attention to the quality of the protein and the frequency at which you consume it. Your body, daily, to function optimally requires all 21 amino acids. However, your body needs to outsource nine of these. Therefore, it is important to make sure you consume enough protein daily to ensure you replenish all nine of these amino acids.
 
But, ensuring you get all nine is not as easy as it may seem. Some of these get denatured when the protein is being cooked. Here is an article that explains what quality protein entails and how you can get it.
 
If you ensure that you consume enough high quality protein daily, it will provide your body with the tools to function optimally. This includes supporting the immune system, improving sleep, focus, reducing fatigue and regulating blood sugar. 
 
Take your protein seriously!

8 Surprising Benefits Of High Quality Whey Protein
Good quality whey has tremendous benefits for the body.  Ranging from anti-aging,  to calming intestinal discomfort; high quality protein can comfort and support your body’s daily needs. With information gathered by our Chief Science Officer Dr Jean Francois Lesgard, we explore 8 ways in which whey optimizes your body and boosts your health.
The right quality of whey, that is grass fed, cold filtration processed, goes well beyond the traditionally perceived benefits such as muscle growth and repair; it supports virtually every system in the body.
 
1. Strengthen immunity and reduce inflammation
With its exceptional richness in essential amino acids (EAAs), particularly in sulfur amino acids (cysteine, methionine), whey can boost our immune system and our anti-inflammatory defenses. Thus it can prevent and be efficient at fighting inflammatory processes and diseases that can be linked to certain food habits (such diets high in sugar & saturated fat or poor in nutrients), lifestyle or environmental aggressions, lack of physical activity, chronic psychological stress, or excess smoking and pollution.
 
2. Anti-aging (a reduction in cellular oxidation)
Ageing, associated with a loss of resistance to oxidative stress, is an inevitable biological process that affects everybody. Our diet, however, can greatly improve this genetic and physiological process. Glutathione is the master antioxidant in the body which can slow down the ageing process. Whey has been shown to be one the greatest sources in food to replenish glutathione thanks to its richness in sulfur AAs (cysteine, methionine) that are the precursors to glutathione production by the body.
 
3. Muscle recovery and synthesis
This is more commonly known, but whey can help maintain or increase muscle mass, especially when paired with resistance training. This is well known amongst athletes and athletic individuals, but it can in fact benefit everybody. Indeed whey protein is one of the best and highest-quality proteins given its very high branched-chain amino acids content (BAAs: leucine, isoleucine and valine) and rapid digestibility to support muscle synthesis.
 
4. Protects against sarcopenia
Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. Indeed, long term muscle loss can be a consequence of the progressive loss of antioxidant potential. This promotes what scientists call inflammaging. Whey is rapidly becoming the proposed protein source of choice to maintain muscle strength in the elderly. Seniors should consume up to 1.5g of protein per kg of body weight per day. Whey (in association with antioxidants from fruits like the ones also present in our products) can significantly reverse this loss of muscle and improve inflammaging.
 
5. Regulate sugar and prevent cardiovascular diseases
Studies in humans show that whey protein can be used in medical/nutritional therapy to regulate blood sugar (hyperglycemia). It can also lower triglycerides, reduce blood pressure and the risk of hypertension and consolidate arterial health. Once again whey, especially in associations with certain vitamins, can be beneficial to the health of your heart.
 
6. Intestinal comfort
Whey is also rich in glutamic acid, an AA that can easily convert into glutamine. Glutamine participates in the regeneration of intestinal cells, intestine health and digestion. Thus whey can improve intestine operation and digestive comfort.
 
7. Regulates body clock, sleep cycles & fights stress
Hormones are very important in the regulation of mood & stress as well as sleep quality. Among them, serotonin has a central importance of regulating our stress response and mood. Melatonin is necessary to reach and maintain proper sleep cycles. Fatigue and stress can lead to many other illnesses and cause inflammatory reactions in the body. This can easily be minimised with the proper protein intake so that our bodies can get the right amino acids necessary to naturally create serotonin and melatonin. The EAA Tryptophan is an unavoidable key precursor of the formation of these two hormones and is less common than other AAs in food proteins.  Guess what? Whey also has a very high content in tryptophan AA in comparison to many sources of proteins.
 
8. Can support weight loss or gain
Whey is a perfect tool to manage weight loss or gain. As it supports lean muscle mass, it can be used as a light snack alone or added to any snack for added nutrition. For weight management or loss, it helps curb sugar cravings and stabilises blood sugar levels. Clinical studies now also show that whey can be of great help in pathologies associated with weight loss.
A diet supplemented with the right quality quality of protein powder can do more than boost your immune system or increase muscle mass. It can completely and holistically optimise every system in your body!
