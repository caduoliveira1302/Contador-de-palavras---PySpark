      Whey protein powder is used in supplement drink mixes and meal replacements aimed at reducing body fat and increasing lean muscle mass. All whey powders are processed to some degree, but hydrolyzed whey undergoes additional processing to break the protein into smaller fragments that may be easier for people with allergies to digest safely.

    Whey Percentages
   In many cases, you can tell how much processing your whey powder has undergone by the percentage of protein it contains. Unprocessed whey protein is simply the clear liquid left over from cheese-making, and dehydrating the liquid turns it into whey powder. Undenatured whey powder is left mostly in that form and contains about 25 percent to 40 percent protein. Whey concentrate powder is filtered further to remove some fats and lactose compounds and has a final protein percentage of 50 percent to 89 percent. Whey isolate, an even more processed form of powder, has the majority of lactose and fat removed and is at least 90 percent protein by weight. Hydrolyzed whey powder undergoes additional processing; it may sometimes be called predigested whey.

    Processing for Allergies
   Because whey is derived from cow's milk, people with difficulty digesting lactose or with cow's milk allergies typically avoid it. Whey concentrate powders contain less lactose than milk and are often easier for people with mild lactose intolerance to digest, but they may not be suitable for those with severe lactose intolerance. Extensively hydrolyzed whey, on the other hand, is less likely to cause allergic reactions and may also be lactose-hydrolyzed. Highly hydrolyzed whey was found to produce no ill effects for more than 90 percent of child subjects with a cow's milk allergy, according to a clinical trial published in the journal ""Pediatric Allergy and Immunology"" in 2001.

    Digestion Speed
   Another key difference between hydrolyzed whey and regular whey is that the body is more easily and rapidly able to digest hydrolyzed whey. Regular whey powder is considered a ""fast-acting"" protein, meaning the body is able to digest it within 30 minutes of consumption, but hydrolyzed whey acts even more quickly. All whey powders may improve muscle size, strength gains and recovery if you drink them after participating in strength training, but hydrolyzed whey increases amino acid availability to stimulate muscle protein synthesis more effectively.

    The Bottom Line
   If you're lactose-intolerant or have a cow's milk allergy and still want to use whey protein, lactose-hydrolyzed powder is likely to be a healthier choice for you than regular whey concentrate. If lactose doesn't bother you, it's a matter of preference. Hydrolyzed whey may seem superior because of its rapid effects, but it also contains denatured proteins that have become less effective during the manufacturing process, so it's not always the ""best"" choice. Because both whey concentrates and isolates are quickly digested, hydrolyzed whey doesn't hold a clear advantage over them. To get the best product while taking into account price, nutrient quality and health benefits, nutritionist and personal trainer Monica Mollica recommends choosing a partially hydrolyzed whey concentrate that contains at least 80 percent protein.

      When you're on the hunt for an easy way to top up your protein intake, whey protein may be a convenient choice. If you have a dairy intolerance, you may be hesitant to consume a supplement derived from milk. You may find, however, that certain types of whey protein don't affect you and are perfectly safe to consume.

    The Deal on Dairy Intolerance
   Dairy intolerance, or lactose intolerance, is a condition in which your body can't digest lactose -- the sugar found in many dairy products. This can lead to bloating, diarrhea and gas. Lactose intolerance occurs when your body doesn't produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for breaking down lactose, so the lactose doesn't digest properly and becomes fermented.

    The Whey and Lactose Issue
   Whey protein contains a relatively low amount of lactose, notes sports scientist Jim Stoppani, though whether you experience the same symptoms as you would with high-lactose foods depends on the level of severity of your intolerance. If you do consume whey protein, Stoppani suggests taking a lactase enzyme before drinking your shake.

    A Better Option
   If you do find that regular whey protein brings on intolerance symptoms, whey protein isolate is made in the same whey as normal whey -- usually referred to as whey protein concentrate -- but the nonprotein components are removed, resulting in a powder that contains very little lactose. Those with lactose intolerance may therefore be able to eat or drink products with whey protein isolate, reports dietitian Karen Giles-Smith.

      Crohn’s Disease
 Crohn's disease causes inflammation in your gastrointestinal tract. Although the inflammation may affect any part of your digestive system, it most frequently causes swelling within the bottom area of your small intestine. Diarrhea is a common symptom of Crohn's disease. Whey protein may increase the risk of diarrhea. There are several theories regarding the cause of Crohn's disease. One of the possible reasons involves the immune system mistaking natural substances as threats, increasing the amount of white blood cells that may lead to chronic inflammation within the digestive tract.

 Crohn's disease is a serious disorder that can lead to weight loss and rectal bleeding. One of the major risks of Crohn's disease is the possibility of nutritional deficiencies, including a lack of adequate protein. The protein deficiency may occur due to an inadequate consumption of this nutrient, as well as the inability to absorb protein through your intestines, also known as malabsorption.

    Protein may have no ill effects on kidneys.
     Whey protein comes from cow's milk. The process of cow's milk being turned into cheese creates whey protein as a byproduct. Whey protein is a complete and high quality protein, with all the essential amino acids. Whey protein is a natural food substance, but is not 100 percent risk-free. Excessive consumption may contribute to kidney damage.

      Benefits of Whey Protein
 The amino acids in the whey protein prove to be essential for the growth of healthy muscles and connective tissue. It improves body composition and enhances athletic performance. Whey protein works to repair and grow muscle tissue, especially after working out. Consumption of whey protein helps prevent bone loss in older adults. Whey protein is highly recommended for people with cardiovascular complications. It is also very important for people with cancer who undergo chemotherapy and radiation treatments and have difficulty supplying the body's nutritional requirements due to appetite loss, nausea and fatigue.

      Risk of Kidney Damage and Whey Protein
 When increased amounts of whey protein are taken over an extended period of time, there is a risk of developing kidney disorders, including kidney stones. High protein diets rich in whey can be a health concern that may lead to possible impaired function of the kidneys. Consuming a high protein diet for weight loss stresses the kidneys, which are responsible for flushing wastes. Those who rely on this diet for an extended period are at a higher risk of developing kidney problems, kidney stones and in severe cases, kidney failure. However, there isn't conclusive research that links excessive, long-term whey protein consumption with deteriorating kidney function. Regardless, many experts caution that there is a risk and encourage individuals to consume whey protein in moderation.

    Preparation
   Whey protein is more convenient than chicken to prepare, as you simply mix whey simply into a shake or smoothie, or incorporate it into cereal, yogurt or baked goods, to benefit from its protein. Chicken, on the other hand, requires cooking. Whey protein needs no refrigeration, while raw and cooked chicken do. Both sources of protein offer versatility in how you can eat them, with whey readily mixed into a variety of foods and chicken eaten baked, fried or grilled as is or added to soups or salads.

    Digestion and Absorption
   Whey has the highest biological value of any food protein, according to the University of Illinois McKinley Health Center. In other words, your body digests whey protein and absorbs it for use more efficiently than all other sources of protein. This feature provides your body with a rapid influx of amino acids to help repair and rebuild muscle after a strenuous physical workout. Conversely, your body digests and absorbs chicken protein more slowly than whey, allowing a gradual infusion of amino acids into your system to provide your body with a steady supply of amino acids over time.

    Pea Protein Powder
   The benefits of protein are clear, and the best proteins come from animal meats or products because they contain all essential nine amino acids, like beef, chicken, fish or dairy. But as diets high in animal products aren't exactly the healthiest either, it may leave you wondering how to get enough protein without eating too much red meat or saturated fats.

      Advertisement
      That's why plant-based protein supplements like pea protein powder have become more popular. The problem is that unlike animal proteins, plant-based proteins are typically low on one or some of those amino acids. Pea protein happens to be low on methionine.
Pea protein is extracted from the yellow pea, and contains a legume amino acid profile. It also contains a higher level of protein than other plant-based proteins like hemp, oat and corn, according to a study published in the December 2018 issue of Amino Acids. This makes it useful as a base in vegetarian and vegan dishes, like vegetarian burgers or as a substitute for dairy in cooking.

      Mayo Clinic states that whey protein may be useful in boosting exercise, treating malnutrition and healing wounds. Bodybuilders and athletes often turn to whey protein as a supplement.
While whey protein may be more popular, research shows that pea protein can be just as effective. A study published in January 2015 in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that pea protein boosted muscle thickness and strength just as much as whey protein.
Another small study published in January 2019 in the journal Sports examined the different effects of whey and pea protein supplements on 15 participants who were taking part in high-intensity functional training. The researchers found that people who used whey protein had similar results to those who used pea protein in conjunction with their eight-week training period.
Participants saw similar levels of strength, performance and muscle composition. The researchers concluded there wasn't a huge difference when it comes to muscle building effects of pea protein vs whey protein.
There are still minor differences, however, that may be noteworthy for certain people. While choosing one over the other may not make or break your muscle building routine, it could still have an impact if you have certain dietary restrictions. If you tend to experience digestive problems from consuming dairy products like whey, pea protein powder may be the better choice.
Whey protein may trigger allergies in people who are allergic to milk or other dairy products. And consuming too much whey protein may also contribute to stomach pain, cramps, nausea and headache.
While both supplements are overall deemed safe, it's still important to be careful when choosing and consuming protein powders. According to Harvard Health, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) allows manufacturers to deem the safety of dietary supplements and label them accordingly. Thus, it can be difficult to evaluate the safety and efficacy of supplements.
Watch out for added sugars as well. Some protein powders may contain up to 23 grams of sugar per scoop, according to Harvard Health. Be sure to read the labels of protein powder products, and combine them with healthy, balanced meals to receive the best benefits from them.

A serving of lean meat is about 3 ounces and provides 21 grams to 24 grams of protein.

    Cooking
   Whey protein does not have to be cooked and can be added to prepared foods such as smoothies, oatmeal or mashed potatoes. Whey protein is added to nutrition bars and made into powders or beverages. Meats do need to be cooked and lean meat is often more tender if braised or stewed for several hours. You can reduce the natural fat content of meat even more by cutting off visible fat, cooking by broiling or roasting instead of frying and draining the fat after the meat is cooked.

    Considerations
   Whey protein and lean meat are different sources of protein. Although whey protein may be more convenient in some ways, meat provides more nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. Whey protein is normally used as a supplement to a balanced diet rather than an integral component of the diet. Consult a health care professional before you take whey protein supplements.

Artigo 9,"Whey protein is a popular and convenient snack on the go, particularly for those following a high-protein diet. When you are searching for new ways to prepare high protein meals, you might wonder whether whey protein is a possible addition to your morning oatmeal. Some proteins, such as caseins, are able to better withstand heat. Whey protein is susceptible to heat, but do not let that deter you from adding it to your nutritious recipes.

    Whey Protein
   Whey comes from cow's milk during the cheese making process. Whey protein powder is a powdered form of the proteins obtained from that liquid. Whey is useful in protein powders because it contains all of the essential amino acids, a high quality protein for those seeking to gain muscle and lose weight. There are numerous types of whey protein, including isolate, concentrate, hydrolyzed and undenatured. Each form differs in its amount of protein, fat, minerals and lactose.

    The Heat Effect
   Chains of amino acid molecules make up proteins, with each type of protein having its own unique sequence of amino acid. When proteins are ""unfolded"" from their natural chain or shape, they are ""denatured,"" according to the Cornell University site. While very high temperatures may cause denaturation of whey protein, according to Cornell University, heat treatments generally will not affect the composition of amino acids or their nutritional content. Severe heat treatments may slightly affect nutrition and amino acids that are particularly sensitive to heat.

    Functionality
   Heat may not affect the amino acid structure of the protein or its nutrients, but it might affect the functionality of the protein. Functionality refers to the behavior of the protein, particularly its solubility. Solubility refers to the ability of a protein to dissolve in a particular solvent. Heat treatments may affect this important feature of whey proteins, making them less soluble. However, according to Ohio State University professor Mike Mangino, total solubility is not required for the protein to remain functional.

    The Scoop
   Heating whey protein may change the protein through the denaturing process, but this will not make it less nutritious or decrease its benefits to your health. Use protein powder to increase protein content of hot cereals, such as oatmeal. You might also find protein powder useful as an ingredient in making cookies, Belgian waffles, high-protein pancakes or for making your own homemade protein bars. Use whey protein to bake high-protein breads or muffins, using a recipe like the one on the Ultimate Nutrition website.

      Whey protein and lactose are both found in milk, but they can be separated from the milk through a lengthy process. Whey does contain lactose, but if you're mildly or moderately lactose intolerant, you may be able to use whey protein without any symptoms. Most whey protein powders contain 0.1 gram of lactose per tablespoon of powder, according to the Whey Protein Institute. If you're severely lactose intolerant, you may need to use a lactose-free protein powder, such as a soy-based protein powder. Before changing your dietary habits, talk with your doctor.

    Whey Protein
   Whey protein is derived from cow's milk. Whey proteins are found in the portion of milk that remains liquid after it curdles. The curd or the hard part of milk contains casein proteins. Whey protein powders are made by dehydrating the liquid portion of the milk and are commonly used to add protein to weight-gaining shakes, bars and other products. Whey protein is listed in the ingredients on prepackaged foods, making it easy to identify.

    Lactose Intolerance
   Lactose is a sugar found in milk that causes digestive difficulty for some people. Lactose is a complex sugar that cannot be digested and absorbed into the body without first being broken down into galactose and glucose. If you're lactose intolerant, you lack the enzyme lactase. Without lactase, the lactose remains in its undigested states, leading to complications when it enters the colon. Lactose interacts with bacteria in the colon, causing gas, diarrhea, bloating and stomach pain. If you develop these symptoms while using whey protein, you should stop using the supplement and call your doctor.

    Treatment
   The most effective treatment for lactose intolerance symptoms is to take a lactase supplement before taking your first bite or sip of whey protein. Taking the supplement will provide your body with the necessary amount of lactase to successfully digest the lactose in whey products. You may be able to handle a certain amount of lactose without taking any medication. Consume 1 teaspoon of whey protein powder to observe if you develop symptoms. Each day increase the amount you ingest by 1 teaspoon until you consume a normal serving or you develop symptoms.

    Allergy Consideration
   If you've been diagnosed with a milk allergy, which is commonly confused with lactose intolerance, avoid the use of whey proteins. Ingesting whey proteins can cause mild to severe allergic reactions such as hives, facial swelling, asthma and digestive complications. If you develop these symptoms, talk with your doctor about allergy testing.
